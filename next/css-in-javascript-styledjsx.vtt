00:00:01.697 --> 00:00:05.302
<v ->Next we want to style our components.</v>

2
00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:07.599
There are a few different options and ways

3
00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:08.935
that we can do this.

4
00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:12.428
And I've had kind of varying degrees of success

5
00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:14.267
which is why you would have seen

6
00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:17.243
that I already include like a default style sheet

7
00:00:17.243 --> 00:00:20.183
one that doesn't have any processing going on.

8
00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:22.673
And because I'm not a big fan of lots of build tools

9
00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:24.779
I tend to gravitate towards this approach

10
00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.413
of having an external style sheet.

11
00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:30.830
However, I do enjoy the benefits of using

12
00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:36.197
preprocessors like Less and SCSS.

13
00:00:39.487 --> 00:00:42.330
And they're useful, right?

14
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.269
So out of the box Next comes with

15
00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.769
something it calls Styled JSX.

16
00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:53.326
And it basically works where you embed your CSS styles

17
00:00:55.673 --> 00:00:58.173
inside of the lock components.

18
00:01:01.203 --> 00:01:02.362
It's not quite the component 'cause you can

19
00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.868
go all the way deep within the tree.

20
00:01:05.868 --> 00:01:08.066
But let's have a look at this talk here.

21
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.468
So what we're gonna do is we're just

22
00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.810
gonna make the twitter handle bold.

23
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.096
Just as a really simple example.

24
00:01:14.096 --> 00:01:16.679
So I can add style and then JSX

25
00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:22.384
and we pass in an object which contains a string.

26
00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:24.611
And this is as simple as doing,

27
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:27.694
we're gonna make the font weight 800,

28
00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:33.290
hit save, and there we go it's made our link bold.

29
00:01:34.363 --> 00:01:37.530
And what's happened here is it's used,

30
00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.679
Next has included this styled JSX framework

31
00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:51.539
and it scopes this bit of CSS to just this p tag.

32
00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:57.446
Okay so it means that not, that just this anchor

33
00:01:57.446 --> 00:02:00.403
within this component is gonna be bold.

34
00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:04.547
Now if I wanted to apply that to all links

35
00:02:04.547 --> 00:02:07.731
that we'd want up here as well I can do global.

36
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.893
'Kay so this is where it doesn't always work for me

37
00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:14.878
so you can see these links haven't gone bold up here.

38
00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:18.479
If I hit refresh you can see now they've gone bold.

39
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.963
So style components don't always inject for me.

40
00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:26.624
Other people have had more success.

41
00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:28.637
And the other thing is that you need to make sure

42
00:02:28.637 --> 00:02:31.970
you have things like syntax highlighting

43
00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.239
or the correct kind of plugin

44
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.855
for the style components to work here.

45
00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:40.688
Otherwise your JSX becomes a mess.

46
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:46.653
And yeah I sometimes see errors with this as well.

47
00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:49.736
So if I'm putting a fragment in here,

48
00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:56.118
so I'm gonna wrap that speaker element in a fragment.

49
00:02:58.882 --> 00:03:01.799
(mumbes) fragment.

50
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.811
I'm just gonna move the styled elements

51
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:09.863
just a little higher up.

52
00:03:09.863 --> 00:03:13.280
I started to see some problems down here.

53
00:03:14.647 --> 00:03:19.647
(mumbles) I'm just gonna do font family monospace.

54
00:03:21.997 --> 00:03:23.274
There's other things like you loose,

55
00:03:23.274 --> 00:03:26.544
I'm loosing the auto-complete.

56
00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:29.469
But this is the error that I've seen before.

57
00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.882
I'm not too sure where it exists.

58
00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:34.792
I am on a stable version of,

59
00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.864
or I thought I was on a stable version of Next,

60
00:03:36.864 --> 00:03:40.179
but I've seen this in stable versions and unstable versions.

61
00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:42.012
Hit refresh, it works.

62
00:03:43.394 --> 00:03:45.471
And it seems to be kind of like on a flip-flop

63
00:03:45.471 --> 00:03:49.314
or to do with fragments, I'm not sure.

64
00:03:49.314 --> 00:03:51.735
So anyway that is one way of doing it.

65
00:03:51.735 --> 00:03:53.595
You can see that when I wasn't using a fragment

66
00:03:53.595 --> 00:03:55.345
it was pretty stable.

67
00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:58.817
And that'll give you styles inside

68
00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:02.724
of your components and every scoped components.

69
00:04:02.724 --> 00:04:04.356
What I wanna show you next

70
00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:07.106
is how to use an import statement

71
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:11.451
with CSS or with SASS or Less.
