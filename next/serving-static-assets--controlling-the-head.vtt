00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.693
<v ->So, now that we have our common layout set up,</v>

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.184
we need that static directory.

3
00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:09.280
Now, next has this special pages directory,

4
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.590
which you've already met,

5
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.120
and there is also the static directory,

6
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.520
literally called static.

7
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.133
Oops, not like that.

8
00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:22.360
Which will serve static content out of.

9
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.400
So, that means if I put an image

10
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.963
inside of the static directory.

11
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.620
Let's call that remy, okay?

12
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.640
And, I go over to my code.

13
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.960
If I open this header and put

14
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.643
this common image source equals.

15
00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:44.770
I'll come back to that in a second.

16
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.510
This is gonna be /static/remy.jpg.

17
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.020
Hit Save, and that will now appear

18
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.820
on the top of all these pages, so.

19
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.230
Anything in that /static page will be served over

20
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.240
as just static content.

21
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.860
And we can change this using a variable

22
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.820
that we pass into next,

23
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.133
and I'll show you that later.

24
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.390
We can change this point to

25
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.020
like a CDN or anything like that,

26
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.970
and I'll show you that in later episodes.

27
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.250
So the next thing I want to do here

28
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.993
is really out of stylesheet,

29
00:01:14.993 --> 00:01:17.663
but my toothy grin is not what we want here.

30
00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:22.110
What we want to do is add in a stylesheet up here.

31
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.110
Now, I could just do link rel equals stylesheet,

32
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.787
href equals static/styles.css.

33
00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:37.940
And I need to put that file in place

34
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.040
so I'm just gonna do touch and styles.css

35
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.140
and I open that styles.

36
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.040
I'm just gonna paste in some styles I already had.

37
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.910
And that will kind of work.

38
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.090
Except, kind of in a weird place.

39
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.053
If we look at the elements, downloads,

40
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.150
just quickly using the

41
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.743
can't sort of find that link element.

42
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.590
Scroll into view.

43
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.093
Reveal in panel, here we go.

44
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.683
So, nope, that was the wrong one.

45
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.713
Excuse me.

46
00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:20.010
Rel equals stylesheet.

47
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.460
There we go.

48
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.760
So you can see it's kind of in the wrong place.

49
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.633
That should be up in the head, right?

50
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.950
Feels wrong that it's down there in that download.

51
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.510
So, another component that next provides,

52
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.510
and we're going to render this in the head of the element.

53
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.983
We're going to import Head from next/head.

54
00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.140
Okay, and if you're familiar with a tool called helmet,

55
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.770
which react helmet, which is basically just

56
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.600
a component where you put all of your head components

57
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.970
like your misc tabs, and all those bits and bobs,

58
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.890
into there, then this is what Head does,

59
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.430
it's kind of a similar thing to that

60
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.780
but it works server side as well.

61
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.570
So we're just gonna pop that into the Head.

62
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.840
Save, and this should just update.

63
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.793
Nothing really happens at this point.

64
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.138
But if we look at that dom tree again,

65
00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:21.783
we should see, there we go.

66
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.598
That stylesheet is in the head element.

67
00:03:25.598 --> 00:03:27.840
And we can do the same thing with a title element,

68
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.673
a title attribute.

69
00:03:28.673 --> 00:03:31.417
So we'll do title, Nextconf Schedule.

70
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.043
Okay, we're building a conference schedule website.

71
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.883
Title, and we're gonna do title, this.

72
00:03:45.807 --> 00:03:48.410
That appears up in the top there, you see?

73
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.950
So I've set a default title because we haven't set one,

74
00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.660
I can do go over to contacts page

75
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.303
and do a title equals Contact us.

76
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.250
So we're on the contact page.

77
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.535
Update, let's go to the About.

78
00:04:02.535 --> 00:04:04.323
We're gonna do title equal, oops,

79
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.450
About, title equals About the app.

80
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.090
All right.

81
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.310
And there you go.

82
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.050
So About the app.

83
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.210
Go over to Contact us.

84
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.350
Looks good.

85
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.349
Just to show you kind of,

86
00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.850
I was gonna show you kind of live injected content,

87
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.100
but I've noticed that a small layout issue over here

88
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.980
where in the layout index page

89
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.810
this should be wrapped in a main element

90
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.550
according to my CSS.

91
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.843
Okay, so I'm just gonna save that.

92
00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:45.843
And I'm gonna give that an id of root.

93
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.439
And it should just kind of relay stuff out.

94
00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.367
There we go.

95
00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:51.910
So, looks pretty nice.

96
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.940
So now I've got static files

97
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.420
and that's where I put any other kind of

98
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.243
static content like images, any other CSS,

99
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.270
any kind of mess tags I might want to add in here as well.

100
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.700
But I have static content

101
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.793
and I've got a common layout.

102
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.880
Now the next thing I'm gonna show you is actually

103
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.540
for every document wink that we make,

104
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.180
every new root we have to import the layout.

105
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.120
Well, next allows us a way of saying actually

106
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.350
this is what the entire document template

107
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.470
will always look like.

108
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.460
So maybe we always want to include

109
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.500
this stylesheet no matter what,

110
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.910
and we don't really want to have to

111
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.990
kind of manually include

112
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.940
it in every project, every component,

113
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.453
so I'm gonna show you in the next video.
