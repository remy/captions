1
00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.672
<v ->Right so, let's go ahead and actually</v>

2
00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:05.592
create our first next application.

3
00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:09.912
Now throughout this workshop I am referring

4
00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:14.061
to these slides, you'll have it in the workshop material.

5
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:18.541
And along with the slides, there are notes tucked away.

6
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:22.840
But also there's a git repo that you can check out

7
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.523
that are tagged which has kinda this code already in place

8
00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:29.080
and you can check out the tags

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.384
throughout the whole of the workshop.

10
00:00:31.384 --> 00:00:35.448
There are links up in the top of the corner of the slides

11
00:00:35.448 --> 00:00:37.069
so you can follow like that, or you can just

12
00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.077
you know, copy and paste as you go along,

13
00:00:40.077 --> 00:00:43.405
but hopefully that source is useful.

14
00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:46.605
So, before we actually even do an npm in it

15
00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:50.851
we need to, like step zero is actually Node.

16
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.080
So make sure that you have the latest version

17
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.080
LTS version of Node, today it's currently eight.

18
00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:04.164
One day it's gonna be 10, but get the latest version of Node

19
00:01:04.995 --> 00:01:07.830
and when you've downloaded that or however you instal Node

20
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.739
you'll also have a copy of npm.

21
00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.899
Which then means that we can do these commands.

22
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.832
So I'm using npn in it dash F which will create

23
00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:20.214
an empty package dot json file for me

24
00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:22.219
with a bunch of defaults.

25
00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:24.950
So you can do npn in it without the F

26
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.054
it will prompt for you things like the project name,

27
00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:29.846
description, that kind of thing,

28
00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:33.096
dash F just force does that for us, and

29
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:37.642
now the next step is to instal the dependency.

30
00:01:37.642 --> 00:01:42.142
So we're gonna go ahead and instal the latest version

31
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.717
of next, react, and react-dom.

32
00:01:45.717 --> 00:01:48.682
Those three things are required to get this project to run.

33
00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:52.932
Now, the site team put out a canary version of next

34
00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.815
which is kinda the upcoming features,

35
00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:02.111
under the @canary tag. So if you want to try out

36
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:06.751
some new features you could do npm instal next @cancary

37
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.418
and that will give you the latest version.

38
00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:12.668
Today, this is installing version five.

39
00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:16.957
I believe version 5.1 is right 'round the corner

40
00:02:16.957 --> 00:02:19.464
some really cool stuff in there, including something

41
00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:22.248
their referring to as universal config

42
00:02:22.248 --> 00:02:25.416
which we will look at later on in this workshop.

43
00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.094
But it's quite possible in the time you're watching this,

44
00:02:28.094 --> 00:02:30.677
5.1 will be the staple release.

45
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.264
So, now that's installed, I have all my packages

46
00:02:36.264 --> 00:02:37.896
but I'm not quite ready to go yet.

47
00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:41.479
I need to, I need to add the start scripts.

48
00:02:43.592 --> 00:02:46.509
So I'm gonna open up my code editor

49
00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.614
okay, and I need to insert some scripts here

50
00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:55.774
so I go over here, I just copy and paste just these bits

51
00:02:55.774 --> 00:02:57.992
And so I have three commands I'm gonna use:

52
00:02:57.992 --> 00:03:00.542
dev, build, and start.

53
00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:03.358
Dev is what we use for logo development

54
00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:07.358
includes hot module reloading, it invokes errors

55
00:03:08.254 --> 00:03:11.070
all that kinda good stuff that we need to debug with.

56
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.163
Build is like a precommand that Next would use

57
00:03:14.163 --> 00:03:16.648
when it moves to production, to repair all of

58
00:03:16.648 --> 00:03:19.112
the Next assets and all the jobs

59
00:03:19.112 --> 00:03:20.830
that actually makes it work.

60
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.368
And then start is for production.

61
00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:25.047
So we will look at releasing into

62
00:03:25.047 --> 00:03:27.309
production later on in this series.

63
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.626
So, let's go back to the command line npm run dev

64
00:03:30.626 --> 00:03:32.194
it's gonna fail because we don't

65
00:03:32.194 --> 00:03:33.965
have any code to run, right?

66
00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:35.522
All we've done is put a package file there

67
00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:37.005
there's none in the outcode place

68
00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.234
so we're gonna do that next.

69
00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:44.234
Okay, so the Setup step one is get the packages in place

70
00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:48.301
Setup step 2 is actually put a file in place.

71
00:03:48.301 --> 00:03:50.114
So we need to have a pages directory

72
00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:52.269
and I'll come on to explaining what that means

73
00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.615
and we are gonna add a file called index.js

74
00:03:54.615 --> 00:03:58.850
and it's just gonna contain this, so let's do that now.

75
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.350
Mkdir pages, okay and in here I'm gonna do

76
00:04:05.677 --> 00:04:09.344
new file, index.js, pop that in there, save.

77
00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:15.149
And I'm gonna do npm, run, dev.

78
00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:21.225
And that's gonna compile and prepare the next server.

79
00:04:21.452 --> 00:04:24.406
So let's pull over to side, let's have a look,

80
00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:25.953
so welcome!

81
00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:27.980
And if you go back to the server we can see,

82
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.249
just scroll up a little bit,

83
00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:30.796
it sees that there was a request for that

84
00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:35.105
index page, and compile that and serve it into the browser.

85
00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:37.605
So that is a next app running.

86
00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:42.034
And like I said, zero config,

87
00:04:43.254 --> 00:04:48.254
this has got a hot reload built in so welcome to my workshop

88
00:04:48.865 --> 00:04:51.244
okay, so didn't have to hit refresh

89
00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:53.075
just injects that straight onto the page

90
00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:54.693
If I had multiple components it would

91
00:04:54.693 --> 00:04:57.105
inject just that component.

92
00:04:57.105 --> 00:04:58.599
The other thing I want to show you is

93
00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.743
that this is actually service I've rendered first,

94
00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:03.697
and then rendered in the browser if required,

95
00:05:03.697 --> 00:05:07.280
we just bring up another terminal down here

96
00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.977
ponies, I'm just gonna do a curl, oops not that one

97
00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.409
lynx, there we go, lynx dump is just

98
00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.654
giving me a text dump of what's on that URL

99
00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:25.300
you can see, that's this text being delivered from

100
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.396
the server you can see it in the network requests as well,

101
00:05:29.396 --> 00:05:34.396
over here, network, preview relational coming over the wire

102
00:05:34.622 --> 00:05:37.065
if you dig through this you should be able to see it

103
00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:41.598
if you go, welcome to my workshop, fully hydrated

104
00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:44.015
react application. That's it!

105
00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:48.724
So, you know, if your entire website is just

106
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:53.097
a single paged plain text app that's all you have to do

107
00:05:53.097 --> 00:05:54.660
you don't have to watch anymore videos!

108
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.043
However, if you want to learn about URLs, debugging,

109
00:05:58.043 --> 00:06:00.400
you know making, this a lot more interesting,

110
00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.799
then, you know, keep watching.
