00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.160
<v ->Hello and welcome to this workshop on Next.js.</v>

2
00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:10.060
So the workshop is going to be multiple videos

3
00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.750
which walks you through

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.750
how to create an Universal JavaScript application,

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.810
software, website, whatever you want to call it,

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.900
using the framework, Next.js.

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.900
So, we're going to build up a conference schedule website.

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.950
I'm gonna talk through how to build that.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.920
There are links to GitHub repos

10
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.860
and specific tags

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.010
where you can copy the code as you go along

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.260
or you can code as you follow along here.

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.310
I'm also going into the details

14
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.543
as to how things work and why.

15
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.670
Talk about some gotchas and some tips

16
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.150
that I've learned along the way,

17
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.010
having built my own Next JS applications,

18
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.420
both for side projects

19
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.110
and for clients in kind of a professional setting.

20
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.610
So before we dig into some code,

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.600
I just want to kinda cover what Next is.

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.440
So Next is a framework for React.

23
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.020
So it kinda abstracts a few things away.

24
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.030
And a few of the things that really draw me to Next is

25
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.150
that the zero configuration.

26
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.123
Literally no webpack files,

27
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.320
no battle lossy files.

28
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.210
I don't have to write any of

29
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.060
that to actually get something going.

30
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.893
You can get very far without any configuration whatsoever.

31
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.460
The second thing is it provides

32
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.090
out of the box service side rendering.

33
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.170
So we're going to, in the next video,

34
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.840
put together a really basic web page

35
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.930
that is hello world using the Next framework,

36
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.150
but I'll show you how

37
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.540
that is rendering both on the client side

38
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.060
when you navigate to it but also on the server side

39
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.374
and delivering all the html,

40
00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:08.330
kind of a hydrated React app over the wire.

41
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.720
So you get all the performance benefits or the SEO benefits.

42
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.210
And really as someone, like myself,

43
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.750
who is kind of an advocate and pro performance,

44
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.750
and using the technology for the best job that it can,

45
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.630
Next is a really, really good fit given

46
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.150
that the amount of set up required is practically zero.

47
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.450
Now there are a few things to do like in soar Next

48
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.500
and write your first page,

49
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.310
but otherwise, there's no configuration.

50
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.433
I'm not a big fan of configuration in the first place.

51
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.230
So Next is used in the wild in a few places.

52
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.200
Here are some of the examples

53
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.740
that I've just pulled

54
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.513
from one of the GitHub issues on the Next repo.

55
00:02:57.353 --> 00:02:59.540
The Open Collective, Netflix jobs,

56
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.200
bunch of different places.

57
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.550
I believe Deliveroo are already using it.

58
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.420
I think that's changed already

59
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.750
and that this issue wasn't made by me,

60
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.473
but it's kinda live, in the wild track places

61
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.373
where Next is actually used.

62
00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.210
Some of the big benefits of Next is well is

63
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.150
that it solves some of your pain points.

64
00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.040
So, I did kind of a canvas, not very scientific survey

65
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.750
but a survey of people who are taking this workshop

66
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.210
and the pain points that keep coming up were webpack.

67
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.500
Now webpack 4 is very good.

68
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.560
It's supposed to be zero configuration

69
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.460
but there's still a little bit that you have to know

70
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.560
where as Next allows you to know nothing about webpack.

71
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.170
Keeping up with a moving technology.

72
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.100
It's a tough one no matter what

73
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.100
but with Next for instance, it works with React 16 today.

74
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.769
Takes advantage of things like code splitting,

75
00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.130
dynamic imports, all of that's out of the box.

76
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.280
A lot of it is kind of,

77
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.990
I don't want to use the word hidden

78
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.460
but kind of happens for you

79
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.710
without having you to do anything.

80
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.360
So, code splitting will happen automatically for you.

81
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.770
This one, it could be time consuming

82
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.663
to get a simple app up and running.

83
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.250
When I see this, it's such a pain point for me, personally.

84
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.130
I hate having to spend an hour just

85
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.100
to be able to get a page to render.

86
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.639
I'd much rather just be writing the logical code

87
00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.287
that does the thing that I want to build

88
00:04:38.287 --> 00:04:39.480
and Next kind of moves

89
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.983
that all of that nonsense out of the way.

90
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.040
And these last two, kind of duplication of back end

91
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.760
and front end and hydration.

92
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.080
Again, Next is gonna reuse the code

93
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.080
that we run inside the client on the server side for us.

94
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.340
Exactly the same code without any additional changes

95
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.203
for us to make.

96
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.080
So Next JS was created by

97
00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:13.940
or put out by Zeit.co.

98
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.623
Really innovative little company.

99
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.410
And they have a deployment platform called Now

100
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.810
which we'll look at much later on in the videos.

101
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.370
That's their main product.

102
00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:29.460
Next was the project that kind of came out,

103
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.110
I think, of this website as well.

104
00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.670
And they are also authors of,

105
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.130
where is it, Socket JS, Socket.io

106
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.863
which you'll be familiar with.

107
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.753
They are very, very solid team of developers.

108
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.700
And it's reliable, it's moving frequently

109
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.630
and there are updates being made

110
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.620
even between running this workshop the first time

111
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.510
and recording this video today, there've been significant,

112
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.830
in fact, there's been a major bump

113
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.550
in the version of Next already.

114
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.160
I expect, if you're watching this a few months

115
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.320
after it's been released, there'll be more updates to Next.

116
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.250
So the place to get Next is from GitHub.

117
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.890
Let's go and head to that open source

118
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.090
which is somewhere here.

119
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.113
Open source.

120
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.263
And scroll on here, this is the one we want to work with.

121
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.457
So, it's all up on GitHub.

122
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.610
I was signed in earlier.

123
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.777
So it's all up on GitHub

124
00:06:36.777 --> 00:06:38.960
and it gives you direction on how to do this stuff.

125
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.930
There's a few decent articles out

126
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.800
on the web, learning resources,

127
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.900
but you'll learn with these videos is a little bit more

128
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.910
of what goes behind the scenes.

129
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.330
Particularly gotchas, workflow patterns

130
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.393
for working with servers and so on.

131
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.930
So, in the next video we're going to get started,

132
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.193
instal Next and create our first webpage.
