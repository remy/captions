00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.800
<v ->Okay, so I've added just a little bit more</v>

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.430
markup to my pages,

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.180
in particular, I've added a link

4
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.533
to my contact page, when I click on it,

5
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.210
it goes to the contact page,

6
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.470
I go backwards and forwards.

7
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.181
And I can actually disable JavaScript

8
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.610
using the dev tools, to just test that that does work.

9
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.260
So when I go back and forth,

10
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.690
it really does render, the links work,

11
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.590
kind of wires up correctly.

12
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.620
Which is great for things like SEO,

13
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.290
and proving the server-side renderings is working,

14
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.330
but in our case, we do actually

15
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.113
want to do a client-side render,

16
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.450
and when I click on get in touch,

17
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.639
I want to do a local history,

18
00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.160
push state, and so on.

19
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.760
So, Next provides a few,

20
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.270
like a handful of components

21
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.200
that you can use within your projects,

22
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.860
and one of them is the link component.

23
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.269
So I'm going to do import,

24
00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.088
link from Next at link,

25
00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.270
and then here, I'm just gonna wrap

26
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.550
my anchor in the link element,

27
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.250
or link component rather, to use the right words.

28
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.800
It's saved,

29
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.683
and oh, got an error here, what do we have.

30
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.952
Href is marked.

31
00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:17.800
Okay, so the thing that's it's complaining about,

32
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.140
is that the href needs to be on the link element

33
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.990
and not on the anchor,

34
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.640
so I'm just gonna move that up.

35
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.390
Okay, hit save again,

36
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.170
and this will reload.

37
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.400
Good, no errors.

38
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.230
If I click on get in touch,

39
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.610
and we're navigating directly inside of the browser,

40
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.610
we can see that, by me clearing my devtools.

41
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.150
If I go back, click, okay.

42
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.150
So there was no request.

43
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.550
The on demand entries, that's the Next

44
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.770
kind of hot module reloading,

45
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.110
and I can hide that

46
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.363
by doing kind of a negative filter.

47
00:01:57.258 --> 00:01:59.512
And there is no request going on there

48
00:01:59.512 --> 00:02:01.300
because that has already cached locally.

49
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.543
If I hit refresh here, okay,

50
00:02:03.543 --> 00:02:06.310
and click on get in touch,

51
00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.980
you can see it's only requesting

52
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.760
the JavaScript file to do the contacts page,

53
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.500
which is where our cosplitting comes into play.

54
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.900
So you can see cosplitting already taking effect.

55
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.410
And in addition, we can do prefetch,

56
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.460
now we won't see this working in development,

57
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.350
but prefetch says when Next takes its markup

58
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.364
and it sees this prefetch attribute,

59
00:02:29.364 --> 00:02:30.960
it will go ahead and do

60
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.630
a request for that contact page,

61
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.370
so that it's already warm,

62
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.130
when I click on it, it'll be kind of

63
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.690
warm in the browser, and it'll be

64
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.113
an instant bit of navigation, so.

65
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.701
It still makes use of the cosplitting,

66
00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.270
but it does it,

67
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.880
it basically just requests it,

68
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.680
once the page is down,

69
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.906
and it just means that navigating

70
00:02:51.906 --> 00:02:54.403
feels really really responsive.

71
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.120
Now, you might notice

72
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.320
I've left the A tag inside there,

73
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.430
if I get rid of this,

74
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.530
it's actually deprecated.

75
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.270
Or it's marked as not supported anymore.

76
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.740
So it still does work,

77
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.410
but what Next wants you to do

78
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.570
is actually wrap it in an A tag,

79
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.130
so you see this down here is an error.

80
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.260
Now, I can do

81
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.055
naughty things like this,

82
00:03:19.055 --> 00:03:21.260
where the

83
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.190
clickable bit, the link,

84
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.900
isn't actually a link,

85
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.223
and it does work.

86
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.760
But don't do that, because, you know,

87
00:03:33.218 --> 00:03:35.420
any crawler that comes to the website,

88
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.730
it can't follow an em tag,

89
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.493
over to the contact page.

90
00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:40.320
And, you know, you'll get any

91
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.920
of the automatic accessibility of the browser,

92
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:43.860
or anything like that.

93
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.720
So even though you can put different types

94
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.003
of elements inside of here,

95
00:03:47.003 --> 00:03:50.110
don't put, you know, non clickable elements.

96
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.340
But you can put a button in here,

97
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.173
for instance.

98
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.240
Okay, and that

99
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.820
I think that would work,

100
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.840
but what makes more sense

101
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.610
is adding kind of an on click.

102
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.210
I'm slightly getting ahead of myself,

103
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.100
but that is how links work,

104
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.642
and again, pretty simple,

105
00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:11.510
automatically takes advantage

106
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.900
of Next cosplitting, prerendering,

107
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.420
and you'll only see prefetch working

108
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.253
when you do your production build,

109
00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:23.507
and you release to production,

110
00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:26.093
but otherwise, that is how it works.

111
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.720
And we will look at

112
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.483
like nice URLs shortly,

113
00:04:36.418 --> 00:04:37.650
which we use the link element

114
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.339
to kind of hide the URL it's using to navigate,

115
00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:43.570
and we can pass query strings and so on.

116
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.983
So we'll see that in an upcoming video.
