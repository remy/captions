00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.200
<v ->Okay, so hooking into more of next components,</v>

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.790
we want to hook into the routing component

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.363
to make use of loading transition,

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.493
and a really nice little package for that is NProgress.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.250
This is what it looks like, it's loading across the top,

6
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.497
and then we can (mumbles).

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.480
It comes with two things, the bar across the top

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.780
and this loading spinner here,

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.200
and you can change colours and so on.

10
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.693
I'm gonna do an NPM instal for NProgress,

11
00:00:36.407 --> 00:00:40.730
and we're also gonna have to go and grab the CSS.

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.623
So we'll do NPM instal NProgress.

13
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.010
I'm also gonna copy this

14
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.060
into the static directory, so static and wget that one,

15
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.070
probably should get compressed version,

16
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.130
but I'll deal with that later.

17
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.233
Then to get it to work on this page,

18
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.514
what we need to do is in my layout,

19
00:01:16.514 --> 00:01:18.570
I need to listen to

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460
the route transitions.

21
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.460
I'm gonna import router from next router, I think it is.

22
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.733
There's actually an example on how to do this already.

23
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.440
In the example's directory, the next author

24
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.570
and you can see all we have to do

25
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.500
is just grab this bit of code, so we're saying,

26
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.360
let's just talk through what we're looking at here,

27
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.130
so we're saying when the router starts,

28
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.650
starts transition and start NProgress and do,

29
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.113
I actually forgot to import it, NProgress,

30
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.830
and when it's complete, the marker is done,

31
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.430
but also there's any errors,

32
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.430
also call the done handler on NProgress.

33
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.850
Let's give that a quick try.

34
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.520
Just do a hard refresh, nothing happening.

35
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.570
Let's check the console to see if

36
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.823
we are doing the loading, we are.

37
00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.340
Ah, we've forgotten the CSS, I've forgotten the CSS.

38
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.713
I'm just gonna add it into here for the time being.

39
00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:45.733
Rel equals style sheet,

40
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.237
href equals static NProgress.

41
00:03:02.363 --> 00:03:05.450
So could be that this is all cached already.

42
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.813
Let's look, we've got the style sheet there,

43
00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:13.150
and no we don't.

44
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.563
Let's just do hard refresh just to be sure.

45
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.020
I think it is showing it,

46
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.603
but I think our colours are completely the wrong colour.

47
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.000
Let's have a quick look at the documentation

48
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.533
on how to change the colour.

49
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.940
Think maybe just NProgress CSS,

50
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.563
the background, let's make that hot pink,

51
00:03:59.446 --> 00:04:02.650
like that, hot pink, yeah.

52
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.733
Let's change these to hot pink.

53
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.087
And then let's give that a try.

54
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.650
There we go, yeah, it was literally

55
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.930
the same colour as my background.

56
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.540
So if any of these pages take a little longer to load,

57
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.610
when these are running in the client side,

58
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.170
but if there's any loading process

59
00:04:25.026 --> 00:04:27.270
and a backend request is happening,

60
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.620
this loading spinner will indicate

61
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.610
that something's actually happening.

62
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.990
These are kind of a big deal, really, because

63
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.020
the more we push rendering into the client side

64
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.010
and there's some API request happening in the background,

65
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.520
if there's no indication that something's happened,

66
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.270
it's very easy to just assume that it's broken.

67
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.590
I literally a week ago put out a bit of software

68
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.940
for one of my customers, and there was no UX to say

69
00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.960
something was happening when they were doing things.

70
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.560
It was just taking two or three seconds

71
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.110
to complete a big batch transaction.

72
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.820
They clicked on a button, not submit,

73
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.760
but a button, and nothing was happening,

74
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.693
but by just adding that one progress loader,

75
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.070
showed them that at least my software had acknowledged

76
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.520
the action the user made, and it was doing something,

77
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.520
so that small change allowed the user

78
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.820
to actually get an idea that something was happening,

79
00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.400
and all of a sudden they feel a lot more confident

80
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.033
in what they're looking at.
