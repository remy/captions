00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:04.390
<v ->Okay, so now that I have a few more pages,</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.550
I have have some clean code edited up,

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.710
I need to address the fact that

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.550
my actual webpage looks ugly,

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.510
or well, I'm not a big fan of Times New Roman.

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.600
So I want to add a stylesheet to this.

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.600
But the thing is at the moment

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.100
I can add a stylesheet to each page

9
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.397
but each page is a separate component by itself.

10
00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:28.930
The about component is its own thing.

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.410
The contact component is its own separate component,

12
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.983
the same thing as the index,

13
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.960
it's completely isolated, they don't share anything.

14
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.990
So what I want to do here

15
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.720
is create a shared layout component

16
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.930
that I would use to add in a common header,

17
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.820
a common footer, and maybe later on

18
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.370
if we have a user that's signed in perhaps

19
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.930
it'll show they're signed in.

20
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.340
And also more importantly to this project

21
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.970
it'll pull in the stylesheet

22
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.690
to get some nice fonts going on.

23
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.360
So I've one and created a directory

24
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.770
called components in the root of my project.

25
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.810
And I've added another directory

26
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.500
inside of that called layout

27
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.510
that has header, footer and index.js.

28
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.760
So now in some projects

29
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.060
I've just had components, layout.js,

30
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.300
and header.js and footer.js

31
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.810
all in the root of components.

32
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.690
For this particular one I decided to

33
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.410
where logical components live together,

34
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.860
put it in its own directory.

35
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.370
So this is what it looks like.

36
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.370
The header has a nav element with a bunch of links.

37
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.020
Nothing special.

38
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.807
The footer is just a text saying,

39
00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:42.427
"This is copyright material,"

40
00:01:42.427 --> 00:01:44.860
"don't steal it or share it with friends"

41
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.540
And the layout index page

42
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.750
just pulls in those two components and renders them.

43
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.380
And this here if you're not familiar with react

44
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.810
there's a couple of things happening here.

45
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.290
First of all, we have the children special property

46
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.980
which when I come to use this layout component

47
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.890
I'll use it like this.

48
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.890
Layout, then I'll put my content in here like this.

49
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.260
Children refers to this kind of subtree basically,

50
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.300
so it's putting the children

51
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.410
between the header and the footer.

52
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.300
And the second thing to note here is

53
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.750
I'm using object destructuring.

54
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.624
So when these components are called

55
00:02:30.624 --> 00:02:35.624
an object called props, generally props is passed in,

56
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.510
and that props will contain children

57
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.140
and then anything else I add.

58
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.183
So class name is a prop.

59
00:02:46.295 --> 00:02:49.473
Alt is a prop, and so on.

60
00:02:49.473 --> 00:02:52.467
So, I'm using destructing to just say,

61
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.497
"I just want this property"

62
00:02:54.497 --> 00:02:59.130
"out of that object and I don't care about anything else."

63
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.480
I could capture the rest using this syntax.

64
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.463
This is all ES6, 7, new syntax.

65
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.630
Just sugar to make things

66
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.150
a little bit easier to work with.

67
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.890
So now I have my common component,

68
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.480
let's go ahead and use this so that it works.

69
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.110
On this page we can see the header and footer

70
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.380
and I can add something about stylesheet.

71
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.650
So at the top of my contact let me do

72
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.650
import layout from components/Layout,

73
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.730
I think I need to do index,

74
00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.700
I'm gonna try it without, see what happens.

75
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.443
And instead of this div I'm just gonna use Layout.

76
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.823
Let's head over to the contact page.

77
00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.160
And there we go, yeah, it's working, perfect.

78
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.383
And so let's just apply this to these two as well.

79
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.880
And to the index page as well.

80
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.713
Pageindex.

81
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.350
So what's interesting here is

82
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.883
I've come up against a small bug.

83
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.643
I added the layout to the index page, okay.

84
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.753
Nothing looks wrong here on initial kind of viewing.

85
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.023
But the layout doesn't appear in my header and footer.

86
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.123
It's not there.

87
00:05:14.281 --> 00:05:18.427
Now it could be that next has compiled page

88
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.370
and somehow forgotten to clear out this cache.

89
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.800
So just for my own kind of well being

90
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.253
I'm just gonna stop the server and start again.

91
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.000
I'm gonna head on over to the web page.

92
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.130
It should actually refresh by itself, might not.

93
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.170
It should get a notification

94
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.813
that the page was rebuilt.

95
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.913
There we go.

96
00:05:44.913 --> 00:05:46.550
So there was something wrong with the cache.

97
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.268
Now, these things happen.

98
00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:51.700
If it's not quite doing what I expected it to do

99
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.430
the first thing I might look at doing

100
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.550
is just restarting the server.

101
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.150
But now we have a common component,

102
00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.013
we are ready to start adding some CSS.

103
00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:08.125
I'm not an advocate of using,

104
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.370
I'm not bored yet with putting my CSS in my JavaScript,

105
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.040
we can certainly do that.

106
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:17.980
There's nothing stopping you from doing it,

107
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.550
you could include it up here,

108
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.680
you could do it on individual components

109
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.287
if that's how you're working.

110
00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.490
I'm still of the thinking

111
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.440
that I'm going to add a separate, static CSS file,

112
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.280
and that's how I'm going to approach this project.

113
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.400
I will kind of show you a little bit

114
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.900
of CSS in JavaScript later on

115
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.270
just kind of for a few tweaks,

116
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.660
but that's how I'm gonna work for the time being.

117
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.510
So what I need to do

118
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.070
is somehow include a static file.

119
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:51.160
So in the next video I'm gonna show you

120
00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.510
where static content lives

121
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.483
and how to get it in the markup properly.
