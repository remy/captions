<v ->Let's look at how to import CSS, using the import</v>

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.750
statement, so if you're like me, and a bit familiar

3
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.750
with create-react-app, then you will use things like this,

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.590
or maybe just the CSS file, but I want to use SCSS,

5
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
now, I already have this file, Session.scss,

6
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.547
okay, so I've got it set up to say I want the speaker's link

7
00:00:31.151 --> 00:00:36.151
to be bold, and next is importing the CSS file,

8
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.230
but it's complaining;

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.230
that it doesn't understand how to parse this text,

10
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.340
understandably, and at this point, I would bust open Google,

11
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.410
start searching babel-loaders, web pack loaders,

12
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.640
and just get awfully confused, copy and past until I find

13
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.193
the right combination of inclinations, incantations,

14
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.110
and hopefully, it will eventually work, and I don't lose

15
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.070
a whole day just trying to do it.

16
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.070
Now, the developers working on Next had issues raised

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.620
about this kind of thing; how do you do it?

18
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.700
And they've basically come up with some plugins

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.700
that make this easy for us, so we're going to use

20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.203
those plugins, and it'll give us support for SCSS files,

21
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.680
so these are the plugins that are currently available;

22
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.770
these are pretty new, as of recording this video,

23
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.770
but they are in use already; this list, I expect to grow,

24
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.060
and we're gonna be using the Next Sass plugin,

25
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.740
it's this one, and there are also some community ones,

26
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.810
I expect, yeah, kind of optimise images, seems like

27
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.910
a sensible one, and I expect these to kind of grow

28
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.550
over time, as people refine their work flows,

29
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.030
so we're gonna use this project, it's gonna go ahead

30
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.030
and npm instal Next Sass, now, whilst that's installing,

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.380
let's go and have a look at the documentation for this.

32
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.750
There are two, key parts that we need to do,

33
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.750
to get a CSS loader to work; the first one is to include

34
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.460
this style sheet, okay?

35
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.310
This style sheet is key, and it's really easy to overlook;

36
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.390
you have to include this style sheet, because this is what

37
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.390
Next will compile inside of its server, and when it imports

38
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.970
your Sass file, it'll turn it into CSS, and it will inject

39
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.290
it into this underscore next static style.css file,

40
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.130
so we have to include this in our document;

41
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.040
now, if you watched the earlier videos, you will have seen

42
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.620
how to use a document for a common template;

43
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.763
if not, have a look at the examples, here.

44
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.120
Otherwise, that's the first step we have to do;

45
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120
the next step is to include the withSass next conflict,

46
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.230
okay, so we're gonna go off to our next conflict,

47
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.690
and we're gonna import the withSass, and all we're gonna do

48
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.330
is just wrap our configuration, withSass, withSass,

49
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.620
and that is it, okay, in theory,

50
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.520
in theory, so we're gonna stop

51
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.480
and start our server, okay?

52
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.480
And this should now have the withSass built in,

53
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.020
and it's now spewing out errors, and for the sharp eyed

54
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.920
developer out there, you would have spotted, below,

55
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.460
we have warnings, okay?

56
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.900
So when I installed node next sass, it was throwing

57
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.700
warnings; the problem is, I have warnings that happen

58
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.780
every time, when I instal, okay?

59
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.300
So a warning about no description in my package,

60
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.550
no repository in my package, and I've become rather blind

61
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.550
to npm warnings, and this is where I basically missed

62
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.720
important messages, and here, we're being told

63
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.670
we need to instal the peer dependency of node sass,

64
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.280
okay, so it's two warnings; one says next sass requires

65
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.160
node sass, and the sass loader requires no sass,

66
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.970
so we need to instal that dependency, as well,

67
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.533
okay, so let's get that going.

68
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.760
I'm going to stop our server whilst that instals,

69
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.183
and once that's done, we will start the server again,

70
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.960
okay, so we're starting the server again,

71
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.490
now we have node sass fully installed, and hopefully,

72
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.220
if we look at our work page, let's give it a wait, maybe,

73
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.193
it should auto refresh, there you go, it auto refreshed,

74
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.270
so it built, but we don't have any styles;

75
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.100
I think that's because I was missing a class name,

76
00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.100
here, Speaker, and there you go, bold,

77
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.530
and it's a lot of work for a bold tag, but hopefully,

78
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.530
you get the concept, so this is now being compiled

79
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.480
in real time; you can see that the font weight, there,

80
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.480
is changing from family monospace, and that's all happening,

81
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.933
look at that; this is potentially why I am not a designer.

82
00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.970
Making fonts bigger, cool, so this works,

83
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.890
but there's one extension I'm going to show you,

84
00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.820
to this; we can actually turn these into CSS modules,

85
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.250
and I quite like this, because it keeps the CSS or the Sass

86
00:05:52.354 --> 00:05:57.354
files separate, whilst having the benefits of scoped CSS,

87
00:06:00.697 --> 00:06:05.697
and if we add just the property CSS modules, true;

88
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.900
we will be able to import the CSS from here,

89
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.663
we just console log that out, just check it works, whoops,

90
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.043
so I think, yeah, I need to do a restyle, here,

91
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.140
because of the conflict change at next level,

92
00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.710
rather than in our code that's being executed.

93
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.977
So just refresh that, that's good,

94
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.400
so I was logging out the CSS, and we can see, we now have

95
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400
kind of a unique ID for, well, scoped value for

96
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.920
our speaker class, and instead of using className

97
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.670
equals Speaker, we'll change that to css.Speaker,

98
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.093
and now, it should continue to work as we expect,

99
00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.610
and let's get rid of that; let's get rid of the font family,

100
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.720
and what it means that our CSS is scoped,

101
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.720
we inspect that link, nope, not that one, okay, here.

102
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.583
Where has it gone?

103
00:07:23.347 --> 00:07:25.597
(mumbling)

104
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.930
Okay, so these are just being loaded, one off the other,

105
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.690
but there, you can see, this is the unique identifier

106
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.483
for that class, so we have scoped, effectually,

107
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.973
scoped CSS, which means if I have a, let me see,

108
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.350
we have a speaker somewhere else, and it won't make it bold,

109
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.835
and I don't know, let's do it here,

110
00:07:57.835 --> 00:08:00.683
className equals Speaker,

111
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.169
so that won't be bold; cool, and effectually,

112
00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.233
we can then make that whole thing a component,

113
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.860
with the styles in one directory, tests in one directory,

114
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.483
JavaScript in one directory, and one nice unit of code,

115
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.223
so that is how to do importing,

116
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.550
well, CSS, but also SCSS, same applies for less,

117
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.650
exactly the same process, just don't forget this one line;

118
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.650
that will be the gotcha; if you forget this line,

119
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.623
it doesn't work at all, cool.
