00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.080
<v ->So this is a really nice feature of Next,</v>

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.288
the ability to take your entire kind of React application

3
00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:12.288
and just spit out static files.

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.760
And the reason I like this is because

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.990
it means I can deploy something like S3 or Netlify.

6
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.050
And I'm gonna show you that in a moment.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.880
But first, we need to configure Next

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.660
so that we can do an export.

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.710
And what we need is this special property

10
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.629
inside of the next.config.

11
00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.629
So what you need to return to this exportPathMap

12
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.163
is an object mapping of URLs to pages.

13
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.500
So let me just grab that and pop it into my

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.500
kind of growing config over here, just there.

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.690
And so we've got the about page, index page.

16
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.690
We're gonna have a contact, that points to the contact page.

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.620
But then we have sessions.

18
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.883
So you've got session.

19
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.310
And what we need to do is go through

20
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.240
each one of these URLs, still not running, npm run dev.

21
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.666
Go through each one of those URLs, the slugs,

22
00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:20.330
and point that to session and then query

23
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.933
at slug is, I think memory is one of them.

24
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.930
And I can programme this, as well.

25
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.053
So I could dynamically generate this object.

26
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:35.460
And so I'm just gonna do a few of these,

27
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.723
copy the URLs.

28
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.311
I'm not gonna bother doing them all,

29
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.023
just so you get an idea of how it works.

30
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.470
So session, page, oops, slash there.

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.470
Page equals session, query, slug, rethinking.

32
00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.060
Let's get password, memory and this one.

33
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.960
Session, query, slug is password.

34
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.910
And one last one, art, which should be easy,

35
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.363
just cut and paste that, oops.

36
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.330
Password or passwords.

37
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.820
Oh, now I'm gonna break it, aren't I?

38
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.647
Passwords, get art.

39
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.460
Okay, oops, arts.

40
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.720
So now in our package,

41
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.640
instead of build just being build,

42
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.010
we want to do &amp;&amp; next export, okay.

43
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.760
And what that's gonna do is create a directory called out.

44
00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.023
So if I run this, npm run build,

45
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.280
it's going to build the next files it needs,

46
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.880
and it's gonna export and generate all those files,

47
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.990
or it should do.

48
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.143
And it'll create a directory called out.

49
00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:13.656
Oh, blew up.

50
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.880
Oh, because the API is missing.

51
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.230
I'll just put that back in.

52
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.790
So I made some changes so that an API would work.

53
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.910
Nope, it's still failing.

54
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.939
So node-fetch is failing.

55
00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:42.480
So I'm looking at statueries here

56
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.583
to understand what has gone wrong.

57
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.863
Not super useful.

58
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.380
So it means somewhere along these lines

59
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.490
when it's doing the export,

60
00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.730
it's going through each page

61
00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.630
and it doesn't have the API.

62
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.890
So I'm guessing it's for the individual session pages.

63
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.190
So we can get rid of that.

64
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.293
And this API value is this thing.

65
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.903
So I've got a feeling that it is inside of

66
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.850
the environment variable.

67
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.850
So we need to do API equals http://localhost:3001.

68
00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:39.848
Let's try that one more time.

69
00:04:39.848 --> 00:04:40.940
It should give us a build.

70
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.810
Okay, so these are the files it has generated.

71
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.630
Let's go and have a look at the out directory.

72
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.910
So if we go into the directory,

73
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.061
and have a look, we've got the next directory,

74
00:04:59.061 --> 00:05:01.490
a whole bunch of stuff that I don't care about,

75
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.604
but this is what we do care about.

76
00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:05.453
Let's just open this up.

77
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.880
You can see we have individual directories

78
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.080
for every one of those sessions.

79
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.940
You see how that's gonna work.

80
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.823
And if we run something like serve,

81
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.625
you'll be able to see, looks the same.

82
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:24.113
It's using the same kind of local navigation, right.

83
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.097
Not all the URLs are there,

84
00:05:27.097 --> 00:05:28.870
because I didn't put them all in.

85
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.480
Oh, this is now hitting an API,

86
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.560
so it's kind of faking it.

87
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.500
But what I want to do now is actually

88
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.810
push that into GitHub.

89
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.663
So, git add -p.

90
00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:44.173
I'm gonna commit those changes.

91
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.940
Trying to deploy to netlify.

92
00:05:57.075 --> 00:05:58.710
Okay, I'm gonna push to GitHub,

93
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.793
so it's going online.

94
00:06:01.002 --> 00:06:03.600
And now in Netlify, I'm going to add a new repo.

95
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.593
And I'm gonna search for next.

96
00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.053
So this one's the one I just created.

97
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.430
Okay, so the build command is npm run build,

98
00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.080
and the publish directory is out.

99
00:06:24.306 --> 00:06:27.510
And I'm gonna make sure that the API is pointing

100
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.950
to my Now website, because I know that that will work

101
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.203
for the time being.

102
00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:38.833
I think we'll do show_speaker, one.

103
00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:44.563
Just deploy that site, and let's see how that goes.

104
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.550
And here we go, it's finished.

105
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.780
It says site is live.

106
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.887
And I go off and I go to the preview URL, there we go.

107
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.823
Working, oh, failed to fetch from client.

108
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.490
So there is, I mean,

109
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:05.990
for a couple of minute's work,

110
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.129
it doesn't seem to like that.

111
00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:12.693
I think it might be the question marks it doesn't like.

112
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.070
So I'm pretty sure that art was in there.

113
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:19.520
Get rid of the question mark.

114
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.750
Yes, so it's the question mark it doesn't like.

115
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.440
Pretty close, though.

116
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.740
So I'll make a follow-up video

117
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.390
just to make these small changes,

118
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.540
but that's to show you that really,

119
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.090
if you want to build out that static site,

120
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.090
it's really just a case of adding this export map,

121
00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.250
that returns an object,

122
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.750
and making sure that all of your query arguments go in.

123
00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:49.920
Now, this could be constructed from an API code.

124
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.670
So I could actually build this out,

125
00:07:52.817 --> 00:07:55.292
since this is a function I could do,

126
00:07:55.292 --> 00:08:00.292
async and then await, fetch and grab that API,

127
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:04.120
I can't remember what the URL is,

128
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.630
but I could go to schedule and then loop over,

129
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:13.100
Json equals, loop over each one of those

130
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.612
schedule items and generate up this block of the pages

131
00:08:17.612 --> 00:08:20.480
when it went to building,

132
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.620
when it actually went to exporting all the pages,

133
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.730
and just do it dynamically,

134
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.083
so that it grows over time.

135
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.950
But that's how to do static generation with Next.

136
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.330
I will do a follow-up video to show you

137
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.793
how to fix that back end.

138
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.800
And I will also post a follow-up video

139
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.800
to show you how to mix using a CDN, like Netlify,

140
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.720
as static content with something like the Now

141
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.320
as the front end with dynamic content,

142
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.560
so that you're gonna get the benefit of

143
00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.100
CDN for static files and dynamic back end

144
00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:00.608
for your back end.
