00:00:00.518 --> 00:00:04.563
<v ->So in the previous video, we added a link element,</v>

2
00:00:04.563 --> 00:00:06.249
and the thing is about that is it's

3
00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:08.210
always going to be there.

4
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.154
And there's gonna be some other meta tags that we always,

5
00:00:12.154 --> 00:00:15.574
like the viewport meta tag, it's the kinda thing that's

6
00:00:15.574 --> 00:00:18.274
always going to be in our document, and not something

7
00:00:18.274 --> 00:00:20.215
that we have to manually add every time,

8
00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:22.715
or manually import every time.

9
00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:27.005
So there is a way, you can customise

10
00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.034
the entire document template.

11
00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:32.445
So if you create a new file called document.js

12
00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:35.474
in your project, so in the pages directory

13
00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.925
you create a document.js file,

14
00:00:37.925 --> 00:00:40.758
and you need to render this block.

15
00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:46.224
So it's important that the Main element is rendered,

16
00:00:46.224 --> 00:00:49.886
Main component rather, and NextScript component is rendered,

17
00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:53.487
because that's what Next uses to put everything together.

18
00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.681
There's an important note in here as well,

19
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.332
that the document.js is only rendered

20
00:00:58.332 --> 00:01:00.612
on the server side and not on the client side.

21
00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:03.892
Things like onClick handlers, any kind of interactivity,

22
00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:06.391
cannot be added at this point.

23
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.623
We're gonna come across getInitialProps later on,

24
00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:11.823
so don't worry about that for the time being.

25
00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:14.372
Here they're using JSX as well.

26
00:01:14.372 --> 00:01:17.273
I'm not using that just at this moment, but what I will do

27
00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:19.190
is just grab this code,

28
00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:26.393
strip out what I don't need, and drop it into our project.

29
00:01:26.393 --> 00:01:29.393
Let's just touch pages, document JS.

30
00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:35.731
Let's get rid of that because we don't want it

31
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:38.888
at the moment; we'll come onto that later.

32
00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:40.721
And flush, and in here

33
00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:46.209
we're going to put our own, this stylesheet.

34
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.321
There's not a huge benefit to me doing this right now,

35
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:54.862
in this particular project, but it's to show you

36
00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:57.891
that you can add your own custom template.

37
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:00.016
In fact, actually I'm gonna do a

38
00:02:00.016 --> 00:02:02.433
meta content equals viewport,

39
00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.399
and then value equals...

40
00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:10.238
Oops, sorry.

41
00:02:10.238 --> 00:02:14.405
Name equals viewport. Content equals device-width.

42
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:21.381
So this kinda thing that I would have in my index pages

43
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:24.964
by default, and we should see this loading.

44
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:30.730
So you view source on this, you can see viewport

45
00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.563
just in there, tucked away, right?

46
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.771
And it means that it should be...

47
00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:41.762
I should be able to see it in kind of mobile view.

48
00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:46.168
But this is how you add any kind of template content

49
00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:49.460
to your document that you will never have any

50
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.293
interactivity for, or need to change in your next project.

51
00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.041
So, the next thing I wanna show you, now that we've

52
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:03.461
got kinda nice styles in place, is maybe hooking

53
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.970
into Next's rooting system so we can have a nice

54
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.471
transition effect between clicking on pages.

55
00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:15.388
So if you look at the Github website, or even Zeit website,

56
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.471
when you're clicking around the links, there's

57
00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:22.221
a nice kind of, maybe not there, there we go.

58
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.930
Nope, none of them have them anymore.

59
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.271
But they used to have transition loaders.

60
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.688
So some may have seen them in Github; we're gonna add

61
00:03:31.688 --> 00:03:33.871
a transition loader to our project as well.
