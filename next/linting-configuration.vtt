00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.720
<v ->Okay, so as I've been writing my very small codebase,</v>

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.832
it's possible that you've been following along

3
00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:11.259
and your code is littered with these red snakes.

4
00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.050
And that's because I think ESLint in VS Code

5
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.555
for me was disabled, but I just re-enabled it,

6
00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:22.979
and now it is just this mess of red.

7
00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:26.419
So, don't worry, I have your back for this.

8
00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.675
In the slides is a link to a gist

9
00:00:29.675 --> 00:00:33.592
that has an ESLint config, and you can instal,

10
00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:37.979
I mean I've installed these now locally to my project.

11
00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:42.979
ESLint, eslint-plugin-react, definite need, config-airbnb,

12
00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:47.477
I was using, but I'm not 100% sure if I need it or not.

13
00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:50.669
But we can instal it just to be on the safe side.

14
00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:52.836
So the gist has two files:

15
00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:55.836
one is the eslintrc file,

16
00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.769
which just is set up to do modules and so on so forth,

17
00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.108
and the second thing is an eslintignore file.

18
00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:09.176
And the first directory it's ignoring is .next,

19
00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:14.076
which contains all the temporary files that compile

20
00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:17.325
to actually render the page, and that's actually

21
00:01:17.325 --> 00:01:20.686
where everything goes when you do a next build.

22
00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:23.017
And the out directory, which is the default directory

23
00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:25.493
for when you're exporting all of next

24
00:01:25.493 --> 00:01:30.202
into a static directory, which we will look at later on.

25
00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:33.426
But I'm just gonna grab this, and I'm just gonna

26
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.413
pop it straight into an ESLint JSON file,

27
00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:39.913
in the root of my project: .eslintrc.json.

28
00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.564
Yes, I wanna save it. Okay.

29
00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:47.064
And magically, all those snakes have gone.

30
00:01:48.623 --> 00:01:50.612
Good stuff. Okay.

31
00:01:50.612 --> 00:01:53.751
And I'm just gonna pop this into eslintignore,

32
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:56.193
so that I can run it on the command line as well.

33
00:01:56.193 --> 00:01:59.610
So I'm just gonna do paste .eslintignore,

34
00:02:04.052 --> 00:02:07.364
and then we can see the file, great.

35
00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:11.588
Okay, so that's how to get rid of your squiggly snakes.
