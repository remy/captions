00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.515
<v ->Okay, so now you know how to instal programmes using Brew</v>

2
00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:07.645
or certainly that was in the previous video.

3
00:00:07.645 --> 00:00:09.877
There are, like I said, different ways

4
00:00:09.877 --> 00:00:12.359
of installing programmes and another one

5
00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.577
of those ways is using something called a gem or a RubyGem.

6
00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:20.744
Now, as far as I remember, most modern Macs will come

7
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:26.081
with this gem installer already installed,

8
00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.278
pre-installed on your Mac.

9
00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:29.830
If that's not the case, you need

10
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.571
to head over to RubyGems.org and go ahead

11
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:37.225
and click on this, installing RubyGems.

12
00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.225
Now, it leads with how to update the gem system.

13
00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:44.997
So gem is like the Brew command that we met earlier

14
00:00:44.997 --> 00:00:49.741
and the MPM command we'll meet in the next video.

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:53.220
Now if you don't have the RubyGems installed,

16
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.671
you go ahead and download, probably a zip file

17
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:58.729
is probably the best format, I would say.

18
00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.238
Unpack it and then, as in unzip the file,

19
00:01:02.238 --> 00:01:04.937
go in to that directory using a CD command

20
00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:09.654
and running this Ruby setup and it will ask you about

21
00:01:09.654 --> 00:01:12.229
some questions on how to actually set it up

22
00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.710
and where you want to go and so on.

23
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.203
Like I said, I believe it's already installed

24
00:01:15.203 --> 00:01:16.927
and a quick way of testing that is just by going

25
00:01:16.927 --> 00:01:21.094
to your terminal and typing gem and here I get some output.

26
00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:26.889
So this means gem is already installed.

27
00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:29.933
Me personally, I've had some trouble

28
00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:32.718
with this whole system with previous machines.

29
00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:34.213
I've had a lot of trouble getting the right version

30
00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:37.124
of Ruby and the right gems and so on,

31
00:01:37.124 --> 00:01:40.927
they're the right package manager and I think I literally

32
00:01:40.927 --> 00:01:44.829
just went through new machines until it worked.

33
00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.033
So I don't have a lot of success with this

34
00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:50.059
but it does work and there are some packages

35
00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:53.205
that are only available inside of this gem system.

36
00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:56.951
Most of them will be in Brew and I personally find a lot

37
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:59.398
of the utilities that I need inside of MPM

38
00:01:59.398 --> 00:02:02.097
but it's worth showing you gems as well.

39
00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:05.680
And one of those is this terminal notifier.

40
00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:11.734
So I've got only a few gems personally installed.

41
00:02:11.734 --> 00:02:14.374
One of them is something called LOL Commits

42
00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:18.550
which takes a screenshot every time I do a commit message.

43
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.581
So I took a screenshot for every commit message I did

44
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:25.916
for the written version of this book, the book

45
00:02:25.916 --> 00:02:29.601
of part version and then turned it into an animated GIF.

46
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:31.339
But this is another thing, this allows me

47
00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.923
to post notifications to my Mac from the command lines.

48
00:02:34.923 --> 00:02:39.090
So someone told me about this, it says what it does

49
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.975
and then it says to download you need

50
00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.102
to do gem, instal Ruby notifier.

51
00:02:46.102 --> 00:02:48.352
The thing to notice here is

52
00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.470
in the read me it has dollar at the front.

53
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.775
Dollar means from the command line

54
00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:56.778
so you don't copy all of that.

55
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:59.695
And it has sudo in square brackets.

56
00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:02.382
Now, I ...

57
00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.999
This is kind of a segway on to sudo as well.

58
00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.056
We're gonna try and run the gem instal.

59
00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:10.422
Where it's in square brackets it means to

60
00:03:10.422 --> 00:03:13.388
don't try and instal it using,

61
00:03:13.388 --> 00:03:15.163
don't worry about these options.

62
00:03:15.163 --> 00:03:17.556
To start off with, you might need it.

63
00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:19.029
However, I actually have just noticed

64
00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.338
that I can also use Homebrew to instal

65
00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:23.267
and personally I probably would.

66
00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:24.514
But I want to show you gem.

67
00:03:24.514 --> 00:03:28.008
So, gem instal terminal notifier,

68
00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.966
I run it and we see what happens.

69
00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.884
Right, so this is what I normally get.

70
00:03:32.884 --> 00:03:34.303
It says you don't have permission

71
00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:37.053
to write to this library RubyGems

72
00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.451
and this is what the square brackets sudo

73
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:44.201
was referring to and sudo, what this means is

74
00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:48.467
as a super user, do a thing.

75
00:03:49.382 --> 00:03:52.051
And the super user is the root user.

76
00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.468
Root is the one user that has

77
00:03:57.096 --> 00:04:00.720
the permissions to do absolutely anything on this computer.

78
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.042
Now, I might be sharing this computer with a colleague.

79
00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:07.083
That user doesn't have permissions

80
00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:10.390
to my files unless I give them permission.

81
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.798
But the root user has permissions

82
00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:13.859
to do anything it wants to.

83
00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.541
Now nobody's logged in as the root user,

84
00:04:15.541 --> 00:04:19.960
I'm logged in as are Rem, you're logged in as yourself

85
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.210
but sudo says run this command as root.

86
00:04:24.136 --> 00:04:26.021
So we're gonna type sudo and then we're just gonna

87
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.848
paste that again and run it

88
00:04:28.848 --> 00:04:32.574
and before any super user command can run,

89
00:04:32.574 --> 00:04:34.170
it prompts you for your password.

90
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.289
It does, if you keep running another,

91
00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:37.842
if you run another command very quickly

92
00:04:37.842 --> 00:04:39.084
or in quick succession,

93
00:04:39.084 --> 00:04:40.579
it won't keep prompting for your password.

94
00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:43.146
There's like a two or three minute delay

95
00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:45.393
until it stops asking for your password.

96
00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:46.743
So I'm just gonna put that in

97
00:04:46.743 --> 00:04:48.931
and then run the command again

98
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.625
and off it goes and instals.

99
00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:52.424
Now, that was pretty quick to come back.

100
00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:54.731
One thing I have personally noticed with gems is

101
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.024
that sometimes they take quite a while

102
00:04:57.024 --> 00:04:59.866
or you have a slower internet connexion.

103
00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.892
It doesn't give you any feedback as to what's going on.

104
00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:04.896
So if it just kind of sits there with nothing going on,

105
00:05:04.896 --> 00:05:07.704
it could mean that it's actually still running.

106
00:05:07.704 --> 00:05:09.171
One quick way of working that out

107
00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:11.588
is if you open your activity,

108
00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.472
the activity monitor, and just kind of search for

109
00:05:18.532 --> 00:05:22.239
gem just to see if something's running or Ruby.

110
00:05:22.239 --> 00:05:23.903
I ten to just leave it for a few minutes

111
00:05:23.903 --> 00:05:25.355
and it does actually finish.

112
00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:26.604
So what do we instal?

113
00:05:26.604 --> 00:05:29.437
We instal this terminal notifier,

114
00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:33.314
hit enter, get a load of output.

115
00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:36.248
Okay, let's have a look at the read me again.

116
00:05:36.248 --> 00:05:37.798
Example usage.

117
00:05:37.798 --> 00:05:40.349
There you go, let's just copy and paste that

118
00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.857
and go ahead and run it.

119
00:05:42.857 --> 00:05:46.266
And we see a piped message data.

120
00:05:46.266 --> 00:05:50.206
So we could probably use this for hooking up some programmes.

121
00:05:50.206 --> 00:05:52.921
I guess you have these lists and so on.

122
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:56.010
I'm not sure how I'd use the actions.

123
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.510
Yes, no and so on.

124
00:05:58.605 --> 00:06:00.882
Maybe if I had like a little programme

125
00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:04.549
that ran to check the weather on my computer

126
00:06:05.866 --> 00:06:09.616
then it would do a terminal notifier message,

127
00:06:12.293 --> 00:06:14.043
"It's going to rain."

128
00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:18.437
There you go.

129
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:22.126
Maybe we can change the icon, I don't know.

130
00:06:22.126 --> 00:06:24.777
But that is another way of installing programmes.

131
00:06:24.777 --> 00:06:28.374
So next I'm going to show you MPM and kind

132
00:06:28.374 --> 00:06:31.521
of the JavaScript world of package managers.
