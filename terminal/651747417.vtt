00:00:03.032 --> 00:00:07.128
<v ->Okay, so last up in the ways to instal programmes</v>

2
00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:10.229
is npm and Node.

3
00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.479
So myself, I am a Javascript developer.

4
00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:18.817
I use Javascript in the client side and on the service side,

5
00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:21.817
and Node is the programme I use to run

6
00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.977
service side Javascript, and the package manager

7
00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:29.508
that's become kind of the default is npm.

8
00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:32.525
npm doesn't actually stand for Node package manager,

9
00:00:32.525 --> 00:00:36.541
it's one of those kind of, it doesn't stand for anything.

10
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:41.290
And the way that you get npm, or the default way

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.299
of getting npm, is going to nodejs.org

12
00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.424
and installing from the landing page.

13
00:00:47.424 --> 00:00:51.022
So it's detected, the website detects that I have a Mac,

14
00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:53.824
it's offering the two versions available.

15
00:00:53.824 --> 00:00:58.102
So there's the LTS, which means long-term support,

16
00:00:58.102 --> 00:01:00.933
which means that this will be supported for several years.

17
00:01:00.933 --> 00:01:05.100
They do have a road map on, oh yeah, you go to LTS schedule,

18
00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.627
so it'll give you an idea when it'll stop supporting LTS.

19
00:01:09.627 --> 00:01:11.008
And you have the current version as well,

20
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:12.925
which is version seven.

21
00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:16.509
So I've already gone ahead and installed this.

22
00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:18.178
I basically clicked on this link.

23
00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:20.928
It downloaded a Mac installable package,

24
00:01:20.928 --> 00:01:24.149
one I had to double click, open it up,

25
00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.156
I went through the different, go next, next, next,

26
00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:28.357
and installed Node six.

27
00:01:28.357 --> 00:01:32.318
But with Node, so if I go into the terminal,

28
00:01:32.318 --> 00:01:35.318
I have Node six, but I also get npm,

29
00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.936
and I get the npm version 3.10,

30
00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:40.695
and that keeps upgrading as well.

31
00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:43.239
And you can upgrade npm separately,

32
00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:45.225
and you might already have Node installed and so on,

33
00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:49.729
but npm is the way that I would instal packages.

34
00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.229
So npm's registry, like Rubygems and Brew,

35
00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:57.607
is on a different URL, so npmjs.com.

36
00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:04.196
And this is the repository for all of the,

37
00:02:04.196 --> 00:02:05.847
where you publish an npm package

38
00:02:05.847 --> 00:02:07.387
and where you download them from.

39
00:02:07.387 --> 00:02:10.727
So I think, certainly when I'm signed in,

40
00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:14.079
there's kind of a list of popular packages.

41
00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.908
You don't need to pay for an account to use it.

42
00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:19.188
This is just for private packages

43
00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:22.593
if you don't want people to be able to instal them.

44
00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:26.760
There is a large number of users that exclusively use npm

45
00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:29.753
and do not publish to npm.

46
00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:32.965
Like, Brew, for instance, I can see in Brew

47
00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:35.653
but I publish back into Brew.

48
00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:39.820
So here's some npm packages that people use a lot.

49
00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:43.525
Funny enough, npm is one of them,

50
00:02:43.525 --> 00:02:44.955
and Grunt you've probably heard of,

51
00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:48.435
Bower maybe as well, Express, Cordova,

52
00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.144
Cordova is PhoneGap, and Gulp as well.

53
00:02:51.144 --> 00:02:53.765
There's a lot, I think there's kind of,

54
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:57.075
300,000 or something like that, they're (mumbles).

55
00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:58.492
350,000 packages.

56
00:03:00.893 --> 00:03:04.765
So I'm going to instal a package from npm.

57
00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:07.154
Again, it wasn't something, you don't know,

58
00:03:07.154 --> 00:03:08.125
like, you can search for things,

59
00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:09.805
but there's so many packages that you kind of end up

60
00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.005
with a lot of results.

61
00:03:11.005 --> 00:03:13.093
We're going to instal (mumbles) with JSON,

62
00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:17.260
JSON, as in the Javascript object notation, (mumbles).

63
00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:23.264
We have one called JSON in capitals and one in lowercase,

64
00:03:23.264 --> 00:03:26.533
which is kind of scary, didn't expect that.

65
00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:29.984
But I searched for JSON, you can see the results,

66
00:03:29.984 --> 00:03:33.567
there's a lot, what's that, 12,000 results.

67
00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:37.285
Actually, I want this one.

68
00:03:37.285 --> 00:03:39.965
I have no idea what this one is.

69
00:03:39.965 --> 00:03:43.315
I mean, I can read, but it's not the one I want.

70
00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:45.595
So this is a little command line utility

71
00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:48.503
that allows me to pipe JSON into it,

72
00:03:48.503 --> 00:03:50.005
and it kind of structures it in a way

73
00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:52.696
that I can process the data.

74
00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.005
So if you look at the readme, I can encode

75
00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:57.502
plain text into it, and I guess it formats it

76
00:03:57.502 --> 00:03:59.795
for me to be able to read, but I can also

77
00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:04.060
query particular properties, I can do some manipulation.

78
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.227
I also find it very useful for kind of querying APIs

79
00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:12.185
and then just kind of putting out one piece of the data.

80
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:16.572
So let me show you how to instal that, for starters.

81
00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:17.964
So I'm trying to see on this page

82
00:04:17.964 --> 00:04:19.742
if it actually shows you how to instal,

83
00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:22.393
and we have installation one, get Node, which we've done.

84
00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:24.983
Step two, npm instal dash g, so we're going

85
00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:27.411
to do that on our command line.

86
00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:30.994
So npm instal dash g, or dash dash global.

87
00:04:33.912 --> 00:04:35.009
And this is important.

88
00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.069
If you don't include the dash dash global,

89
00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.052
it will instal the npm package into your working directory,

90
00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:43.772
which is not what we want for utility.

91
00:04:43.772 --> 00:04:47.332
Something that we're going to reuse on our command line,

92
00:04:47.332 --> 00:04:50.900
like the Pony, say, or the (mumbles) Fire.

93
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.441
We want a global instal package,

94
00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:56.411
and there's a bunch of shortcuts that we use,

95
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:58.161
that we can use, which you can see here.

96
00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:01.744
Dash g means global, I can do npm i dash g,

97
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:05.151
but just for your sake, I'm going to do

98
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:06.901
global and then json.

99
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:14.048
So that's going to go off, and I have permission, terrific.

100
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.443
And, let's see, so I think it's conflicting

101
00:05:21.801 --> 00:05:23.369
with a previous instal I have.

102
00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:25.569
So I'm just going to pause and fix this.

103
00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.700
Okay, so I fixed that and reinstalled it,

104
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.283
and now, if you have a fresh instal of npm

105
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:36.020
or a Node and npm, you shouldn't get permission errors.

106
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.441
It is possible that you do get permission errors,

107
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.860
and the temptation then might be to use Sedu,

108
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.193
that we met earlier in the Gems example.

109
00:05:46.441 --> 00:05:50.300
Now it's generally recommended you don't do that,

110
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.560
and there are directions on the npm help

111
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.749
on how to fix those kind of things.

112
00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:57.369
The reason I actually had it is because

113
00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:00.241
I have two users on this machine,

114
00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:03.100
this Screencast user and my personal user.

115
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.100
But I've gone ahead and fixed that.

116
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.401
And like I said, I'll include a link in the notes

117
00:06:09.401 --> 00:06:12.348
on how to fix in a Sedu problem,

118
00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:15.561
but now, after I've already installed npm,

119
00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:20.220
sorry, JSON globally, I have this utility, JSON.

120
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.500
And when I run it, nothing happens,

121
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.909
cause I have to give it some content.

122
00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.030
So I'm going to just do echo,

123
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.321
in fact, I'm just going to grab the example up here,

124
00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:32.821
echo, and just pipe that string into JSON.

125
00:06:38.588 --> 00:06:39.838
So echo age 10.

126
00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:43.599
Like I said, what I use it for is plucking out

127
00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.425
particular properties, so here I've pulled out the age,

128
00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.406
and I think you can see the kind of manipulation,

129
00:06:48.406 --> 00:06:52.489
which may not be, oh gosh, it doesn't work today.

130
00:06:54.359 --> 00:06:56.084
This dot age, I think it is, yeah.

131
00:06:56.084 --> 00:06:58.334
So you can do manipulation.

132
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.328
There's a whole bunch of other things that you can do,

133
00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:04.808
but I tend to use it for formatting,

134
00:07:04.808 --> 00:07:07.808
so I actually can read large blocks of JSON,

135
00:07:07.808 --> 00:07:10.488
or just pulling out one specific property.

136
00:07:10.488 --> 00:07:12.320
In this case, I'm using age, but maybe

137
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.299
you want to (mumbles) some kind of API,

138
00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:20.466
for instance, here's some, I think Javascript registry.

139
00:07:22.239 --> 00:07:23.854
I think it's the right URL.

140
00:07:23.854 --> 00:07:25.006
So here's a bunch of Javascript.

141
00:07:25.006 --> 00:07:29.538
This is basically the JSON behind this page here,

142
00:07:29.538 --> 00:07:31.439
the MPM page.

143
00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:35.439
If I do curl and the URL and then pipe the JSON.

144
00:07:37.468 --> 00:07:39.286
So curl is going to go and grab the URL

145
00:07:39.286 --> 00:07:43.453
and then pipe the output string into the JSON command,

146
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:48.588
and then I should be able to just read,

147
00:07:48.588 --> 00:07:51.255
if I wanted the readme filename,

148
00:07:52.378 --> 00:07:55.087
it just gives me that one bit.

149
00:07:55.087 --> 00:07:59.279
So without the json part, I'm just grabbing that URL

150
00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:01.039
and just spitting it out on the screen,

151
00:08:01.039 --> 00:08:02.567
and then with the json part, I'm able

152
00:08:02.567 --> 00:08:06.287
to kind of see it formatted properly,

153
00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:08.586
make it a bit more readable, look through the properties,

154
00:08:08.586 --> 00:08:11.394
maybe I want all the contributors.

155
00:08:11.394 --> 00:08:14.207
So I go ahead and just put json contributors,

156
00:08:14.207 --> 00:08:15.575
and there I've got them.

157
00:08:15.575 --> 00:08:18.116
And I can do things like dash a, which tricks it

158
00:08:18.116 --> 00:08:22.247
as an array, and then I can get out the name, I think, yeah.

159
00:08:22.247 --> 00:08:24.266
I kind of think, oh, it didn't quite work.

160
00:08:24.266 --> 00:08:27.599
But still, there's lots of npm programmes.

161
00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:31.495
Once, I mean, I work with one quick load,

162
00:08:31.495 --> 00:08:36.185
one is the free Node development, it automatically restarts.

163
00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.847
Know when you make file changes, and there's a tonne

164
00:08:38.847 --> 00:08:41.358
of utilities on there.

165
00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:42.800
Obviously I can't think of any off the top of my head

166
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.488
right this second, but I'm also intending

167
00:08:45.488 --> 00:08:48.155
to record some videos on kind of

168
00:08:49.578 --> 00:08:52.027
front end development and tools that can help you.

169
00:08:52.027 --> 00:08:54.637
So, like I said, Nodemon is one of those,

170
00:08:54.637 --> 00:08:58.448
so you can do npm instal dash g nodemon,

171
00:08:58.448 --> 00:09:00.579
and it'll give you this programme

172
00:09:00.579 --> 00:09:04.776
that will auto restart your server when files change.

173
00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:08.577
This thing can check dependencies, that's linting.

174
00:09:08.577 --> 00:09:12.049
If you use Sublime or Atom, typically they want you

175
00:09:12.049 --> 00:09:15.466
to instal things like ESLint or CSSLint,

176
00:09:17.082 --> 00:09:18.529
or anything like that.

177
00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:21.308
And it'll be through npm.

178
00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:23.228
So that's all of our installers.

179
00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:24.938
Hopefully you can go ahead and you now know

180
00:09:24.938 --> 00:09:28.978
how to run programmes locally, they're in your path,

181
00:09:28.978 --> 00:09:31.628
you can instal new programmes through Gems,

182
00:09:31.628 --> 00:09:33.890
through Brew, and through npm.

183
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:36.930
If you want to try Python, please do, go ahead.

184
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.097
I've never been successful at it, it's very tricky.

185
00:09:42.058 --> 00:09:43.475
So there you are.
