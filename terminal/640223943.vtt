00:00:03.482 --> 00:00:05.963
<v ->So now that we've gotten past</v>

2
00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:07.630
opening the terminal

3
00:00:08.576 --> 00:00:11.025
and kind of staring at this black screen,

4
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:12.679
we want to be able to do something.

5
00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.596
Now the very very basic

6
00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.218
kind of first steps

7
00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.261
of using the terminal

8
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:24.233
is being able to navigate your directory structure.

9
00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.566
Now I have on my hard drive,

10
00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:29.925
my computer, my blog.

11
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.731
Okay so in this document directory

12
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:35.716
I have my blog here

13
00:00:35.716 --> 00:00:37.892
and a whole bunch of files.

14
00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:40.309
Inside of public is a list of

15
00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:44.760
all the blog posts in markdown.

16
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.655
Now it's great.

17
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:46.725
But how do I get there

18
00:00:46.725 --> 00:00:48.216
using the terminal?

19
00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:50.286
Okay so here's a few commands

20
00:00:50.286 --> 00:00:51.710
that we're going to use

21
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.917
pretty much all the time

22
00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.239
when we're using the terminals.

23
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.877
The first one is ls,

24
00:00:55.877 --> 00:00:59.869
and ls will list everything that's in the directory.

25
00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.284
So ls will just kind of print

26
00:01:01.284 --> 00:01:02.970
everything on the screen

27
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.803
but it's not very clear

28
00:01:03.803 --> 00:01:06.202
kind of what's what at this point.

29
00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:08.736
So another version of this is to use

30
00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.069
ls and then dash

31
00:01:10.982 --> 00:01:14.037
and then everything afterwards is a switch.

32
00:01:14.037 --> 00:01:16.048
So this says list.

33
00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:18.885
L means list in one long list

34
00:01:18.885 --> 00:01:20.827
rather than kind of horizontally.

35
00:01:20.827 --> 00:01:22.910
T means to order by time,

36
00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:27.307
and r means to show me in reverse order

37
00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:30.841
which means that the newest will be at the bottom

38
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:34.424
so basically the closest to my prompt here.

39
00:01:35.788 --> 00:01:38.777
So it's extremely common for me to type

40
00:01:38.777 --> 00:01:39.694
ls dash ltr

41
00:01:40.554 --> 00:01:41.658
to look at the directory listing.

42
00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:44.544
And this gives me a whole bunch of information.

43
00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:47.707
So let's have a brief look at this.

44
00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.891
So over here in the corner

45
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.759
we have all of these

46
00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.342
kind of characters.

47
00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:58.001
We've got these numbers, my name, this staff thing,

48
00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:00.337
another set of numbers,

49
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.259
something looks like a date time stamp

50
00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.431
and then the name.

51
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.181
Okay so the important parts here are

52
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.928
obviously the time stamp.

53
00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.832
So the newest one is at the bottom

54
00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:13.679
because we've reversed by time.

55
00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.953
We also have the owner here

56
00:02:15.953 --> 00:02:19.219
who has access to read and write the file.

57
00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.462
And in this case it's me.

58
00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:21.827
My user is called rem.

59
00:02:21.827 --> 00:02:24.045
When I logged into my machine, I'm rem.

60
00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:27.476
So that means that it belongs to me.

61
00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:30.093
And over here on the far left is

62
00:02:30.093 --> 00:02:34.398
kind of information about this particular entry.

63
00:02:34.398 --> 00:02:36.244
Now you don't have to worry too much

64
00:02:36.244 --> 00:02:37.792
about what's actually here.

65
00:02:37.792 --> 00:02:40.529
Really the only that it's telling me is that,

66
00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:42.779
or the only interesting piece of information is that

67
00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.999
it's a directory, this d

68
00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.092
which we already know if we look

69
00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:50.123
at the home directory in Finder, right?

70
00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.225
And then also what permissions I have.

71
00:02:52.225 --> 00:02:53.225
So read is r

72
00:02:55.064 --> 00:02:58.345
write is I can actually make a change to the document

73
00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.645
and execute means I can run things inside there.

74
00:03:00.645 --> 00:03:03.582
And we'll look at executing later on.

75
00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:05.108
And then everything else is for other people.

76
00:03:05.108 --> 00:03:08.904
So if I share this machine with someone else

77
00:03:08.904 --> 00:03:10.934
then in this case

78
00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:13.964
they have no permissions to my documents

79
00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:16.252
but in this public folder up at the top

80
00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:17.768
you can see they have

81
00:03:17.768 --> 00:03:20.201
read permissions afterwards.

82
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:23.010
So I won't dwell on this too much

83
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.998
but really there's just some extra meta information.

84
00:03:27.998 --> 00:03:29.773
This number you don't need to worry about.

85
00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:31.690
It means links I think.

86
00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.894
Something you don't have to worry about again.

87
00:03:37.894 --> 00:03:39.458
I think this is the file size

88
00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:43.010
but directories don't particularly have file sizes.

89
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.927
So my blog is over in this Documents directory.

90
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.562
Where is it?

91
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:50.910
Documents and then remysharp.

92
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.490
How do I get there from the terminal?

93
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.834
Well I type change directory, cd

94
00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.441
and then the directory I want to move into.

95
00:03:58.441 --> 00:04:01.024
So I can start typing Documents

96
00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:03.870
and I can type out the whole thing

97
00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.396
or I can start typing

98
00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:08.064
and then hit tab

99
00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:09.717
and it will try and fill out

100
00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:12.020
the rest of the match

101
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.152
everything that's listed in this directory.

102
00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.501
So if I just type D

103
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:15.550
and hit tab

104
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.383
you can see I have

105
00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:19.591
two directories beginning with D, Downloads and Documents.

106
00:04:19.591 --> 00:04:23.174
And it doesn't auto fill out straight away.

107
00:04:24.524 --> 00:04:26.056
I have to hit it twice

108
00:04:26.056 --> 00:04:27.916
and it will say I've got a few choices.

109
00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:30.881
Desktop, Documents, or Downloads.

110
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:32.131
So if I type Do

111
00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:35.185
gives me a bit more.

112
00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:37.103
Down, there we go.

113
00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:40.324
Okay so I'm now in the Downloads directory.

114
00:04:40.324 --> 00:04:41.799
I've changed Directory into Downloads

115
00:04:41.799 --> 00:04:44.088
and you can see now here

116
00:04:44.088 --> 00:04:46.886
you can see the Downloads appears.

117
00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:48.958
This is the directory I'm currently in.

118
00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.257
We look back earlier

119
00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.292
you can see this tilde.

120
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:56.352
That character it means the home directory.

121
00:04:56.352 --> 00:05:00.253
So you'll see that whenever you're in the home directory

122
00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:03.342
we can actually use this if we want to.

123
00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:05.820
So I can do cd and then tilde

124
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.100
and it will take me back to the home directory.

125
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.870
But I'm going to stay in the Downloads directory

126
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.453
for the time being.

127
00:05:13.344 --> 00:05:14.774
Once we're here

128
00:05:14.774 --> 00:05:15.720
you'll notice I'm right at the bottom

129
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.553
of my terminal.

130
00:05:16.553 --> 00:05:18.461
I prefer to look up.

131
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:19.961
So I can clear the screen.

132
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.976
You can type clear

133
00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:23.226
or you can type

134
00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.144
wrong directory

135
00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.394
you can type control+l

136
00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:34.937
and that will also clear the screen.

137
00:05:34.937 --> 00:05:37.188
So where were we going?

138
00:05:37.188 --> 00:05:39.116
We were going to Documents not Downloads.

139
00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:42.283
So Documents and I type in ls dash ltr

140
00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:46.704
and then remysharp and a cd r tab.

141
00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:49.677
We're back in ls.

142
00:05:49.677 --> 00:05:53.710
And I want to go into the public and then blog directory.

143
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.443
So from here I can actually join up the directories.

144
00:05:55.443 --> 00:05:57.860
I can do public and then blog

145
00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:03.666
and I'm now going to move directly into this directory.

146
00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:06.052
I do an ls.

147
00:06:06.052 --> 00:06:09.076
You can see all of my blog posts.

148
00:06:09.076 --> 00:06:12.486
Cool so I've moved into a directory.

149
00:06:12.486 --> 00:06:16.076
I can see the current directory I'm in right now.

150
00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:18.508
I can see the full path of the directory I'm in

151
00:06:18.508 --> 00:06:19.591
by typing pwd

152
00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:23.698
so present working directory.

153
00:06:23.698 --> 00:06:25.305
So it's not something you need to know very often

154
00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:26.470
but sometimes you want to

155
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.612
kind of see where you are.

156
00:06:28.612 --> 00:06:30.695
So pwd will give me this.

157
00:06:32.322 --> 00:06:35.679
Okay so I'm deep in this directory.

158
00:06:35.679 --> 00:06:38.930
What happens if I want to go back up into remysharp?

159
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.657
Well I could type cd tilde

160
00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:43.267
and then kind of go forward from there.

161
00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:45.741
But I can also kind of navigate up and down

162
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:47.861
the tree of directories.

163
00:06:47.861 --> 00:06:49.375
Now to do that

164
00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.792
I use two periods

165
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:52.838
so cd dot dot.

166
00:06:53.743 --> 00:06:56.798
So dot dot means the parent directory.

167
00:06:56.798 --> 00:07:00.965
So this will move me from the blog up into public.

168
00:07:02.671 --> 00:07:03.932
So now you can see I'm in public.

169
00:07:03.932 --> 00:07:04.971
So I type in pwd.

170
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:05.962
I'm in public

171
00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:06.863
and I can join those together.

172
00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:08.676
So I go back into blog

173
00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:12.127
and I can do cd double slash dot dot slash

174
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:16.235
and that will take me from blog into public

175
00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.429
and then to the public's parent directory

176
00:07:18.429 --> 00:07:20.629
which is remysharp.com.

177
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:23.027
Enter, there we go.

178
00:07:23.027 --> 00:07:24.942
Okay so I'm moving around directories.

179
00:07:24.942 --> 00:07:26.999
And we can join these up together.

180
00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.999
So I can do,

181
00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.263
where were we?

182
00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:34.016
Public, blog, so I can type cd double slash.

183
00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:35.912
I can go into my draughts

184
00:07:35.912 --> 00:07:37.435
and that will just move up a directory

185
00:07:37.435 --> 00:07:40.527
and then down into the draughts directory.
