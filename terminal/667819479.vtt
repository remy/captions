00:00:01.775 --> 00:00:03.378
<v ->Okay, so is this the last section</v>

2
00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:05.694
on causing damage to your machine.

3
00:00:05.694 --> 00:00:07.425
We've learned how to delete files,

4
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.921
completely override system permissions,

5
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.329
delete files that don't belong to us,

6
00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.734
delete files or directories that are empty;

7
00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:16.271
and now I'm gonna show you how

8
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:20.459
to completely stop programmes running in their tracks.

9
00:00:20.459 --> 00:00:22.670
So there's a few commands that we can use

10
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.084
to see what programmes are running

11
00:00:25.084 --> 00:00:28.402
and one of them, which I'll refer to

12
00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:32.133
in my kind of workflow quite frequently is PS,

13
00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.716
so process status I'm guessing.

14
00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:40.647
And it'll list the processes, processes,

15
00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:44.814
processes, processes, processes that I'm running by default.

16
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:51.168
So we have this thing called a pid, and it's the process ID.

17
00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:53.986
So every process has a unique ID

18
00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.552
that identifies it running on this machine,

19
00:00:57.552 --> 00:01:00.493
so I am, you can see everything I'm running.

20
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.668
I'm running iTerm, which is this programme,

21
00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:05.708
and I'm running a bash instance,

22
00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:08.375
which is this command line here.

23
00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.814
There is this ruby command over here that I'm running,

24
00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:17.731
which is, I think it is doing capturing tweets;

25
00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.736
and this is the file that's--

26
00:01:23.736 --> 00:01:25.499
this is the command that's actually saving it to a file,

27
00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:26.994
and this is another iTerm instance

28
00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:28.246
that's down near minimise

29
00:01:28.246 --> 00:01:29.406
and that's the other bash instance.

30
00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:34.298
So you can see everything that my user is running right now.

31
00:01:34.298 --> 00:01:35.757
Except I'm also running some other things

32
00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:39.772
like the whole operating system and Chrome Canary

33
00:01:39.772 --> 00:01:41.140
and some other bits and bobs,

34
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.057
so there are arguments that you can pass to PS;

35
00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:50.716
and the ones that I tend to use all the time are auxww.

36
00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:53.268
So much so that I have forgotten what they all mean,

37
00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:58.002
and I'm pretty sure this is like show all processes;

38
00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:00.555
so now we see a lot more

39
00:02:00.555 --> 00:02:03.207
from all users, oh shit, yep.

40
00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:06.176
So now we see remy; we see root.

41
00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:08.162
We see rem at the bottom there,

42
00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:11.579
and X, I can't really remember what X is.

43
00:02:14.132 --> 00:02:15.969
Just a lot more information,

44
00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.908
and then ww is super wide.

45
00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:22.573
It gives us the full command so that when I grep,

46
00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:24.127
and I'm about to show you that;

47
00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:26.613
it has the whole line to actually grep on.

48
00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.530
So this is pretty, pretty unwieldy.

49
00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:31.560
There's a lot of information here.

50
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.330
I don't tend to look at it like this.

51
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.247
What I'm doing here is first saying

52
00:02:38.207 --> 00:02:40.340
grab everything that's running

53
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.259
and always then pipe into grep

54
00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.437
because I'm tend to be looking for one particular thing.

55
00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:49.604
So let's open up Canary and head over to my blog briefly,

56
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.450
and let's just stick that on the side.

57
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.484
There we go.

58
00:02:54.484 --> 00:02:59.469
So what we're gonna do is we're going to look for Canary.

59
00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.751
Okay, so I'm gonna grep for Canary;

60
00:03:02.751 --> 00:03:05.918
and it shows some of the Canary items,

61
00:03:07.251 --> 00:03:10.668
and I only did a partial bit of the word,

62
00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:14.122
but what I'll also do is do dash I.

63
00:03:14.122 --> 00:03:17.289
Dash I means ignore case, just in case

64
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.448
I've got the casing wrong basically.

65
00:03:20.448 --> 00:03:22.531
So there's so much there

66
00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.876
that I'm kind of not sure how many I have,

67
00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:26.709
so I'm just gonna pass it

68
00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.659
straight into wc just to get a count.

69
00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.282
So we have ten.

70
00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:32.056
Ten Canaries were matched,

71
00:03:32.056 --> 00:03:34.288
and I've only got one running Canary.

72
00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:37.392
Now I know it's because I'm signed in as another user,

73
00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:39.002
and I have other tabs open;

74
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:41.499
and there are plug-ins running and so on and so forth.

75
00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.995
So I've got a lot of kind of floating bits,

76
00:03:44.995 --> 00:03:47.735
and typically when I'm using PS,

77
00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:51.197
I tend to be looking for one process;

78
00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:55.925
and it'll be that I might wanna stop that process,

79
00:03:55.925 --> 00:04:00.587
or I wanna see if it's even running in the first place.

80
00:04:00.587 --> 00:04:03.735
But I'm gonna show you how to kill a process here.

81
00:04:03.735 --> 00:04:07.597
So we're looking for Canary at the moment.

82
00:04:07.597 --> 00:04:09.107
This isn't particularly useful.

83
00:04:09.107 --> 00:04:10.559
There's too much information here.

84
00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:12.892
What I wanna do is look for

85
00:04:14.361 --> 00:04:16.465
the one that's being run by rem.

86
00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.477
So I'm gonna grep for rem, and that's not useful either

87
00:04:18.477 --> 00:04:21.575
because the other user's called remy.

88
00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:24.949
I could grep for rem with a space.

89
00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:26.649
That's one way of doing it.

90
00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:28.301
That kind of narrows it down a bit,

91
00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.010
and we're still quite a bit going on.

92
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.766
Let me just do a quick wc again, five;

93
00:04:32.766 --> 00:04:37.705
but, in theory, these are all the ones that belong to me.

94
00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:41.288
Let's pass that to less, have a quick look.

95
00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:44.912
Yeah, it looks like--

96
00:04:44.912 --> 00:04:46.377
I'm just kind of looking over on the left

97
00:04:46.377 --> 00:04:49.630
just to see these first lines.

98
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.543
They all do look like they belong to me.

99
00:04:52.543 --> 00:04:55.528
Now what I need to do now is get the process ID.

100
00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.558
I'm going to kill that process ID.

101
00:04:57.558 --> 00:05:01.391
So, there's a few ways that I can do this now.

102
00:05:03.882 --> 00:05:06.329
I'm gonna show you a command called awk.

103
00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:08.487
I'm not really gonna teach you how to use it fully

104
00:05:08.487 --> 00:05:12.570
because it is a whole programme language in itself.

105
00:05:14.018 --> 00:05:17.006
I'm just gonna show you one command,

106
00:05:17.006 --> 00:05:20.768
so print dollar one; and I put it inside a quotes.

107
00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:24.276
And what it's gonna do is it automatically breaks up

108
00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:29.138
each line into a column, and it will print the first column;

109
00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:33.156
and then if I wanna print the second column,

110
00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:35.878
I just put a space in between.

111
00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:39.266
That's obviously how you use spaces, I say sarcastically.

112
00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:41.611
And then column two, which is dollar two;

113
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:43.932
and now I have the process ID.

114
00:05:43.932 --> 00:05:48.015
So with that I should be able to kill my browser.

115
00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.132
Now, let's get rid of the rem part

116
00:05:55.132 --> 00:05:56.946
because I know that they all definitely belong to me.

117
00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:58.497
I've just got to press IDs.

118
00:05:58.497 --> 00:05:59.352
What I'm gonna do is go through

119
00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:03.416
each one of those and kill that process.

120
00:06:03.416 --> 00:06:05.583
I'm gonna start with the--

121
00:06:06.726 --> 00:06:09.147
well, I'm gonna sort those actually.

122
00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:11.711
I'm gonna start with the biggest number

123
00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:14.303
just in a hope that it's the one I'm looking at.

124
00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:17.897
So I'm gonna just type kill and give it the process ID,

125
00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:21.730
and that tells me there is no such process ID.

126
00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:24.714
Oh, yep, it's vanished.

127
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:30.076
In fact, I can see that last number keeps changing;

128
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.140
so we see it's 53 and 59 and so on and so forth.

129
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.521
So I'm gonna try this one instead,

130
00:06:37.521 --> 00:06:39.421
and it's probably because Chrome has like some,

131
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:41.449
it's spawning extra things.

132
00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.908
So I'm gonna kill this process,

133
00:06:43.908 --> 00:06:45.716
and look what just happened.

134
00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:47.633
We blew up a tab, nice.

135
00:06:49.214 --> 00:06:50.548
But I wanna blow up the whole thing,

136
00:06:50.548 --> 00:06:53.248
so I'm gonna bring back my window.

137
00:06:53.248 --> 00:06:56.530
So we've got all these Chrome matches.

138
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.863
We're gonna pass all of those into kill,

139
00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:02.369
and we use xargs.

140
00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:06.536
What xargs does is take the output from the left side,

141
00:07:08.198 --> 00:07:10.315
and it passes it as an argument

142
00:07:10.315 --> 00:07:12.815
to whatever we give to xargs.

143
00:07:13.793 --> 00:07:15.988
So I'm gonna do kill, and what happens is basically all

144
00:07:15.988 --> 00:07:20.255
of these IDs will end up on the end of the kill command.

145
00:07:20.255 --> 00:07:22.297
And I run it; it's gone.

146
00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:25.214
I've just blown up Chrome entirely.

147
00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:30.345
So, that's how you kill a command using the command line

148
00:07:32.709 --> 00:07:35.655
or, certainly, that's I'd find a command, look for Canary,

149
00:07:35.655 --> 00:07:39.340
make sure it's mine, find the process ID, and then kill it.

150
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.564
Now there are other ways as well.

151
00:07:40.564 --> 00:07:44.316
There's a process called pid, a command called pidof,

152
00:07:44.316 --> 00:07:48.348
which isn't installed here, but we can do a brew instal.

153
00:07:48.348 --> 00:07:49.978
And I've gone and installed a pidof

154
00:07:49.978 --> 00:07:53.570
using my other user on this machine

155
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.694
because I didn't have permission with this particular user,

156
00:07:55.694 --> 00:07:59.857
but now I've installed pidof using brew,

157
00:07:59.857 --> 00:08:02.649
I can type pidof Chrome;

158
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.247
and it will give me the process ID

159
00:08:04.247 --> 00:08:06.664
of all the Chrome instances.

160
00:08:07.624 --> 00:08:12.094
And if I wanted to, I could then pass that to xargs kill;

161
00:08:12.094 --> 00:08:13.794
and it will kill Chrome entirely.

162
00:08:13.794 --> 00:08:16.456
But if you notice down at the bottom I'm not--

163
00:08:16.456 --> 00:08:17.972
I am not running Chrome;

164
00:08:17.972 --> 00:08:20.600
the other user is running Chrome,

165
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.608
and that will pretty mess up my day a little bit.

166
00:08:22.608 --> 00:08:25.275
So we're gonna see pidof sketch.

167
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:31.506
So I'm signed in as another user on this machine,

168
00:08:31.506 --> 00:08:36.481
and I'm running sketch could kill all the sketch instances.

169
00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:39.231
I'm gonna try; permission denied.

170
00:08:40.722 --> 00:08:43.230
Now we've seen this before when we tried to delete files,

171
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.266
which means we can get around it.

172
00:08:46.266 --> 00:08:48.107
The poor, unsuspecting other remy

173
00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:49.877
is running sketch right now;

174
00:08:49.877 --> 00:08:52.627
and I could go ahead and kill it.

175
00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:57.901
And before I do, I just wanna show you the activity monitor,

176
00:08:58.757 --> 00:09:02.090
which is not firing up activity.

177
00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:05.992
The activity monitor is pretty much the equivalent

178
00:09:05.992 --> 00:09:08.542
to what we're looking at;

179
00:09:08.542 --> 00:09:11.327
and you'll find it under utilities, I think.

180
00:09:11.327 --> 00:09:13.115
Activity monitor, here we go.

181
00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:16.757
So these are all the processes that are running

182
00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:19.646
under this machine right now,

183
00:09:19.646 --> 00:09:22.310
including from other users, I think.

184
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.365
Oh, no, it's not.

185
00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:24.615
I think I can--

186
00:09:25.525 --> 00:09:28.136
maybe I can actually show other users.

187
00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:32.288
So if I search for Chrome, nothing is listed.

188
00:09:32.288 --> 00:09:33.633
You got all processes.

189
00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:37.016
Here's what pidof was finding, all of these processes here;

190
00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:40.446
and you can see that column pid over here.

191
00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:44.613
So we look for sketch, we can see the two sketch processes.

192
00:09:45.916 --> 00:09:49.031
I believe that this one is a child of this one,

193
00:09:49.031 --> 00:09:51.241
so that's why there's two;

194
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.435
and we can see the owner, user is remy.

195
00:09:54.435 --> 00:09:55.975
But we're gonna go ahead and kill those anyway,

196
00:09:55.975 --> 00:09:59.503
and I think you can do it from here as well.

197
00:09:59.503 --> 00:10:01.525
There we can force quit the process,

198
00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.509
and the reason I'm showing you on the command line again

199
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:06.934
is if you have to-- if you can't do it from the GUI,

200
00:10:06.934 --> 00:10:09.528
or if you're having to do it on a remote machine.

201
00:10:09.528 --> 00:10:13.445
So what we're gonna do now is just a sudo kill,

202
00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:17.175
and we're gonna put in our password;

203
00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:18.342
and it's dead.

204
00:10:20.172 --> 00:10:24.339
So that has shut down in the other user's account.

205
00:10:25.297 --> 00:10:27.387
None of them are running.

206
00:10:27.387 --> 00:10:29.328
No pidof sketch.

207
00:10:29.328 --> 00:10:31.828
Now, what we just did is tell

208
00:10:33.422 --> 00:10:35.965
that process to shut down using the kill command;

209
00:10:35.965 --> 00:10:37.441
and there is another--

210
00:10:37.441 --> 00:10:39.779
we were pretty forceful with our sudo,

211
00:10:39.779 --> 00:10:41.887
but there is another way of killing it as well;

212
00:10:41.887 --> 00:10:45.006
and we have kill minus nine.

213
00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:49.753
Kill minus nine means force the programme to quit

214
00:10:49.753 --> 00:10:52.059
regardless of whether or not there's any kind of prompting

215
00:10:52.059 --> 00:10:54.270
or kind of exit handling or anything like that.

216
00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:57.867
It just says just completely get it shut down.

217
00:10:57.867 --> 00:11:00.098
Now you might have--

218
00:11:00.098 --> 00:11:02.376
oh, I was gonna open another window.

219
00:11:02.376 --> 00:11:05.014
You might have a process that's spinning out of control,

220
00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:08.361
using all your CPU; and, you know,

221
00:11:08.361 --> 00:11:12.528
you can't get to it using-- you can't even load it up.

222
00:11:14.887 --> 00:11:16.560
Kill minus nine and then the ID

223
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.623
of the process will force the shutdown

224
00:11:19.623 --> 00:11:22.929
and just instantly kill it in its tracks.

225
00:11:22.929 --> 00:11:25.902
And then, of course, sudo kill minus nine is kind of

226
00:11:25.902 --> 00:11:30.392
the mega mega make this thing stop for sure.

227
00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:33.062
So that's probably the most lethal you can get.

228
00:11:33.062 --> 00:11:36.213
If you absolutely wanna make sure the process is

229
00:11:36.213 --> 00:11:38.551
it stops in its track, then kill,

230
00:11:38.551 --> 00:11:42.718
sudo kill minus nine and the process ID and it will stop.

231
00:11:43.718 --> 00:11:46.396
Just as a little anecdote,

232
00:11:46.396 --> 00:11:50.229
old Linux machines used to have the process ID

233
00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:53.823
of the entire operating system used to be one;

234
00:11:53.823 --> 00:11:57.240
so you could do sudo kill minus nine one,

235
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:01.094
and that would completely shut down

236
00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:03.222
the entire operating system.

237
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.328
Thankfully, it's impossible to do now.

238
00:12:05.328 --> 00:12:07.860
It's just the system is protecting itself

239
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:11.395
from idiots like me trying to shut down my entire machine

240
00:12:11.395 --> 00:12:13.110
whilst I'm recording a video.

241
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.306
So, now that we know how to do some damage,

242
00:12:16.306 --> 00:12:17.994
the next video I'm gonna show you,

243
00:12:17.994 --> 00:12:20.975
we'll show you how to check the health of your machine.
