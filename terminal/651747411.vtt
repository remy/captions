00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.982
<v ->So you want to install a programme on your computer.</v>

2
00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:09.174
And the way that you might be used to installing something

3
00:00:09.174 --> 00:00:11.478
is clicking on a link, downloading it,

4
00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:15.512
double click, big, nice install box and off you go.

5
00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:18.639
The terminal is different and now

6
00:00:18.639 --> 00:00:21.249
there are different ways of installing programmes.

7
00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.542
But if you have a Mac one of the most common and easiest

8
00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:29.709
ways is using a programme called Homebrew, Brew for short.

9
00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:34.744
So the url is brew.sh and it's a utility

10
00:00:34.744 --> 00:00:37.056
that gives you access to install

11
00:00:37.056 --> 00:00:39.889
other utilities or other programmes.

12
00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:44.940
So it's fairly painless to get

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.814
this installed in the first place.

14
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.929
So, they have this installing Homebrew.

15
00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:53.950
You literally just copy and paste this entire line

16
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.460
and you drop it into your console.

17
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.941
Now, I've already installed Homebrew

18
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.041
so it should be trying to redo it.

19
00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.917
It's asking me for my password because it needs

20
00:01:04.917 --> 00:01:07.413
to be able to put things in different places.

21
00:01:07.413 --> 00:01:09.430
Looks like I am actually installing

22
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.949
Homebrew again, but it should be fine.

23
00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:14.351
And what that would do is give

24
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:16.680
me a little command called Brew.

25
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.910
And from there, if I open, it's already ready,

26
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.724
I can give a different argument so at the end

27
00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:24.692
of the installation it said I can

28
00:01:24.692 --> 00:01:27.070
run Brew help, so I'm going to type that.

29
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.072
And that's going to show me the different commands.

30
00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:33.662
Now, I can search for different formulas,

31
00:01:33.662 --> 00:01:36.280
so the formulas are kind of the packages

32
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.790
and packages of, basically, programmes.

33
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.692
You can search for them, you can find information

34
00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:44.134
and go back to the Home page for them.

35
00:01:44.134 --> 00:01:46.743
Brew install and Brew uninstall are basically

36
00:01:46.743 --> 00:01:49.936
the two things that I use all the time.

37
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:53.036
So, in the same Home page we have

38
00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:57.598
an example of using wget, wget basically gets a webpage.

39
00:01:57.598 --> 00:02:01.098
I've already installed that, I think, yep.

40
00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:08.045
So if I type in wget and then take the url just,

41
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:11.630
it'll download the index page and we can see it there,

42
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.797
save to index one, I can cat that out.

43
00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:21.250
There you go, so that is this page.

44
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.031
So you're going to sort of, there's

45
00:02:24.031 --> 00:02:26.706
a whole bunch of other programmes you can install.

46
00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:29.113
But without knowing what they are, how do

47
00:02:29.113 --> 00:02:30.903
you know what to install, right?

48
00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:33.315
Well, the way that I've approached it is

49
00:02:33.315 --> 00:02:36.877
on Twitter or through a peer or colleague,

50
00:02:36.877 --> 00:02:39.973
they say to me oh, I use such and such programme,

51
00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:43.223
it's really good for linting or running

52
00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:45.508
local development servers or just

53
00:02:45.508 --> 00:02:49.208
making the terminal look more interesting.

54
00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:52.093
And one of those more interesting programmes

55
00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:54.850
I heard about was Ponysay.

56
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.184
So there's a old Unix programme called Cowsay

57
00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:00.419
which basically prints an ASCII cow

58
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.704
and it says a thing, but this is a spin on that.

59
00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:07.772
So I googled Ponysay, and I've got two results

60
00:03:07.772 --> 00:03:10.298
and the first is a GitHub project.

61
00:03:10.298 --> 00:03:12.891
The second one looks like a homepage,

62
00:03:12.891 --> 00:03:15.251
so I'm just going to go the homepage

63
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.974
just to show you my workflow to try and install this thing.

64
00:03:18.974 --> 00:03:23.469
And I see a picture of a terminal and the pony

65
00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.831
and that's what I want to just kind of liven up my terminal.

66
00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:30.914
And I can see down here is installing

67
00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:37.763
and then some words, really, from upstream,

68
00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:40.790
package repositories, exotic operating.

69
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.152
Is a Mac exotic?

70
00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:44.323
It's kind of exotic.

71
00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.956
At this point I'd probably abort and go back

72
00:03:46.956 --> 00:03:49.882
to my google search results and click on the first one.

73
00:03:49.882 --> 00:03:52.384
So it looks like pretty much the same thing.

74
00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:54.222
This is GitHub and really, I'm

75
00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:56.184
not interested in all these files.

76
00:03:56.184 --> 00:03:59.543
The meat of what I'm looking for is down here, the README.

77
00:03:59.543 --> 00:04:01.732
Why this isn't higher up I don't know.

78
00:04:01.732 --> 00:04:04.727
So, yep I want this pony on my terminal

79
00:04:04.727 --> 00:04:06.901
just to lighten it up a little bit.

80
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:09.740
And here we go, installing on GNU/Linux

81
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.606
and other Unix implementations.

82
00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:16.773
Now, a Mac is actually based on a Unix implementation

83
00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:21.300
so we might be able to use the information here.

84
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.299
So what I'm doing is literally

85
00:04:23.299 --> 00:04:26.252
just scrolling down looking for words I recognise.

86
00:04:26.252 --> 00:04:29.458
And here we go, Mac OS X, that's the one we want.

87
00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:33.387
And it just says, a ponysay Homebrew formula is available.

88
00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:36.388
And they've put the ponysay part in code

89
00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:39.440
and what that's telling me is I should be able

90
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.964
to do Brew install and then the name of that programme.

91
00:04:42.964 --> 00:04:44.851
So I'm just going to try that.

92
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.015
I'm going to back to my terminal

93
00:04:47.015 --> 00:04:49.765
and type brew install and then ponysay.

94
00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:53.216
And it should go through the whole process

95
00:04:53.216 --> 00:04:56.216
of doing the brewing of the ponysay.

96
00:04:57.817 --> 00:05:01.108
So poured it, and it says summary and it gives me

97
00:05:01.108 --> 00:05:05.275
the little beer icon which means, I guess, it's all good.

98
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:08.910
So we'll try it.

99
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.762
Ponysay, execute, alright we've got some output.

100
00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:15.480
That's pretty good, that's kind of what I wanted.

101
00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.724
Although, actually, really what I wanted was a pony

102
00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:22.029
so it says Hello World, hey, there we go.

103
00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.500
We scroll up a bit, we can see

104
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.165
the pony's actually saying, Hello World.

105
00:05:27.165 --> 00:05:30.928
And now I have a completely useless programme on my computer.

106
00:05:30.928 --> 00:05:33.683
But what I can do is I can figure my prompt,

107
00:05:33.683 --> 00:05:36.037
so that when I open a new terminal,

108
00:05:36.037 --> 00:05:39.238
every time it can generate a new pony for me every time,

109
00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.186
just to kind of make things look

110
00:05:41.186 --> 00:05:44.499
colourful on this rather bland screen.

111
00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:49.134
So that's Brew, and there are lots of different programmes

112
00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:52.673
that are a lot more useful than this pony.

113
00:05:52.673 --> 00:05:57.164
For instance, there's the, if you're familiar with Lynx

114
00:05:57.164 --> 00:06:01.164
the text browser there's also that in Brew lynx.

115
00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:05.209
So you can browse

116
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.746
the web in plain text

117
00:06:10.746 --> 00:06:14.921
which might be pretty retro, might be good for the hipsters.

118
00:06:14.921 --> 00:06:17.387
But, actually, it's quite useful

119
00:06:17.387 --> 00:06:20.063
for pulling down just the text of a webpage.

120
00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:23.480
So I think you can use lynx to, man lynx,

121
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.616
so if you want any help, I tend to use google,

122
00:06:27.616 --> 00:06:30.600
but you can type man which is short for manual

123
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.431
and the name of the programme, and it

124
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:35.964
will give you the manual for the programme.

125
00:06:35.964 --> 00:06:38.589
And in here somewhere should be how

126
00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:41.942
to just print the page on the screen.

127
00:06:41.942 --> 00:06:45.524
I'm sure it's in there, I know it's in there somewhere.

128
00:06:45.524 --> 00:06:49.733
Another quite useful little tool I have is gifify.

129
00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:53.185
I think, yep, gifify, that came through Brew as well.

130
00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:56.489
So that Brew install gifify and what that would do is

131
00:06:56.489 --> 00:06:59.941
it will take a video file like an mp4 and generate a gif,

132
00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:02.396
an animated gif so I can just use that.

133
00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:05.411
Even though, technically, it ends up being larger

134
00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.265
than the video, not that clever for the web.

135
00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:10.435
But still, sometimes a gif kind of

136
00:07:10.435 --> 00:07:14.371
works better than a video in some cases.

137
00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:16.850
And there's a whole tonne of things.

138
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.375
You can google things like best homebrew packages

139
00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:25.058
and you'll get lots of people's opinions on first things

140
00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:28.199
to install, and must-have and so on and so forth.

141
00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.150
So that was Brew, bit of a whirlwind tour,

142
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:34.006
but definitely useful and, like I said, pretty much

143
00:07:34.006 --> 00:07:36.763
the go-to way of installing programmes.

144
00:07:36.763 --> 00:07:40.767
If you land on that README page take a look at the,

145
00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:43.543
look for, this is on Homebrew and

146
00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:46.088
you can just install from there.
