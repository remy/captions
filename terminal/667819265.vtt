00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:06.549
<v ->Okay, so welcome back, and in this video section, or this</v>

2
00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.139
series of videos we're gonna learn how to do two things.

3
00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.806
One, mess things up,

4
00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.066
cause a bit of havoc,

5
00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.149
break things.

6
00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:22.045
So be careful, and the second part will be how to kind of do

7
00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.628
some simple health checking on the machine.

8
00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:31.168
So to start off we're going to be looking at deleting files.

9
00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:32.001
Now,

10
00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:35.624
you may not want to,

11
00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:37.190
you may not feel comfortable

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.156
to do all your kind of

13
00:00:39.156 --> 00:00:41.989
file deletion on the command line.

14
00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.482
But I'm showing you firstly to show you how

15
00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.580
to do it, so that you know

16
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.412
it exists, but also to show you how to do forced deletes

17
00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:53.571
and delete files that you don't really have permission to

18
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:56.687
delete, but also if you get to the point where

19
00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.078
you're connecting to remote machines, some kinda web server

20
00:01:00.078 --> 00:01:02.712
you'll need to know how to use these commands anyway.

21
00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.462
So, to delete a file,

22
00:01:05.318 --> 00:01:06.901
we need to rm.

23
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.755
rm is short for remove.

24
00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:10.779
So rm, and then the name of the file.

25
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:13.529
So, we're in my home directory

26
00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:16.965
We've got a couple of, we've got the demo file that I made

27
00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:21.589
in the previous video for grepping, so to remove that file

28
00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:23.338
we do rm demo.

29
00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay, pretty simple and it's gone. There's no prompting,

30
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.713
there's no asking, it belonged to me, and

31
00:01:29.713 --> 00:01:32.054
that file is now gone.

32
00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:36.289
It's not in my recycle bin, it is permanently gone.

33
00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.781
There are possibly tools out there that can recover the

34
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:44.002
file, but from a UI perspective, from the GUI,

35
00:01:44.002 --> 00:01:47.459
the Mac's GUI, I can't recover it.

36
00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.384
So the files now gone, I don't know what the contents of it

37
00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:52.301
is anymore, I can't get back to it.

38
00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:56.987
So that's done, it's pretty,

39
00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.166
well, I mean, I own that file

40
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.437
so really I ran the command, so you know I should've kinda

41
00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:09.710
known what I was doing, that's why there was no prompting.

42
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.043
Now if I try and

43
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.874
delete,

44
00:02:13.874 --> 00:02:15.825
I can, well, let me see.

45
00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:20.022
We can go into directories and we're just gonna quickly make

46
00:02:20.022 --> 00:02:22.105
a directory, "mkdir foo",

47
00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:26.203
so "make directory" mk is short for

48
00:02:26.203 --> 00:02:30.580
make directory foo, and to remove that directory,

49
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.393
we look, we've got a directory here, I do rmdir foo.

50
00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:39.083
So remove directory, if I try and just,

51
00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:39.976
before I do that

52
00:02:39.976 --> 00:02:43.749
if I just do rm foo, it just says it's a directory,

53
00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:44.916
can't do that.

54
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:50.243
And if I try and make a whole bunch of files, if I quickly

55
00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:54.410
make some files, I can delete more than one file at once.

56
00:02:56.275 --> 00:02:58.505
I'm gonna use touch command, touch will basically just

57
00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.524
create an empty file, and I'm just gonna create

58
00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:02.941
a bunch of files.

59
00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:07.377
So this should be, yeah lots of files, they're empty files,

60
00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:10.515
nothing in them, and I just used a little command, "touch"

61
00:03:10.515 --> 00:03:14.558
will make the file and these braces mean, it just allows me

62
00:03:14.558 --> 00:03:16.457
to do more than one at a time.

63
00:03:16.457 --> 00:03:20.953
So I'm gonna do "rm 1 2 3", and they're all gone.

64
00:03:20.953 --> 00:03:22.115
So do multiple files at once,

65
00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:25.137
but I can't remove this directory.

66
00:03:25.137 --> 00:03:27.220
But I can do "rmdir foo",

67
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.917
and it goes, and it doesn't prompt because I own it again

68
00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:35.167
and the directory has gone.

69
00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:38.680
There we go, it's just completely empty.

70
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.586
So, I'm just using "open" for Finder, obviously a Mac

71
00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:46.639
specific thing, that's this demo-folder right here, and I'm

72
00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:51.278
gonna go ahead and back up to the parent directory,

73
00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:55.467
and I'm gonna try and remove the demo-folder.

74
00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:58.974
So, "rmdir demo-folder/",

75
00:03:58.974 --> 00:04:00.666
and typically we would expect it

76
00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:02.499
to be removed as well,

77
00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:05.754
oh actually let's stick a file in there,

78
00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:08.343
so "touch demo-folder/1", so there's

79
00:04:08.343 --> 00:04:12.085
now a file inside of there, demo-folder.

80
00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:14.149
I think the Finder is still there, no it's not.

81
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.002
If we try and remove that directory,

82
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:18.669
"rmdir demo-folder",

83
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.433
it says it's not empty, so it doesn't want to go ahead and

84
00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:24.613
get rid of it until we get rid of the file, so let's just

85
00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:27.970
quickly get rid of that file, okay so that's gone.

86
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.767
Have a quick look inside, looks empty, try to remove the

87
00:04:31.767 --> 00:04:34.517
folder, and it's not empty still.

88
00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:37.629
The reason it's not empty is there is actually a hidden file

89
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:39.885
in there, and if you use a Mac, you

90
00:04:39.885 --> 00:04:42.978
might've seen these .ds_store files.

91
00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:45.675
Now when we looked in the directory we didn't see it.

92
00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:48.318
If we try and open the directory, we can't see it, unless

93
00:04:48.318 --> 00:04:51.960
you have a special flag turned on,

94
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.682
but if we do "ls -ltr",

95
00:04:54.682 --> 00:04:58.849
which is my favourite way of listing directories, if I do,

96
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:03.868
I think it's "a", "demo-folder/",

97
00:05:03.868 --> 00:05:06.154
"a" means show all files,

98
00:05:06.154 --> 00:05:07.595
including hidden files.

99
00:05:07.595 --> 00:05:11.762
And there it is, that .DS_Store file, they get everywhere.

100
00:05:13.506 --> 00:05:16.256
It's like cat-fur under the sofa.

101
00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:20.537
So, we have a choice here, we can manually go ahead and

102
00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:24.028
delete each one of these files, or the .DS_Store file.

103
00:05:24.028 --> 00:05:28.068
So maybe inside of that demo folder we had a whole bunch of

104
00:05:28.068 --> 00:05:30.735
other files, "1, 2, 3" in there,

105
00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:33.523
maybe we had another

106
00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:37.240
sub-directory inside of there, and really we're feeling

107
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.628
a bit lazy, we don't wanna delete every individual file, and

108
00:05:41.628 --> 00:05:46.115
the hidden file, what we can do is do a forced delete.

109
00:05:46.115 --> 00:05:50.360
So we can do "rm demo-folder/",

110
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.443
that will fail but if we do "rm -rf",

111
00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.003
that's a recursive forced delete, so what that

112
00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:02.056
will do is it'll delete the demo folder,

113
00:06:02.056 --> 00:06:04.061
it will go into the demo folder and

114
00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:06.119
recursively go through every single file and

115
00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:09.469
every directory that's in there, and force delete it, and

116
00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:11.110
then delete the demo directory.

117
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.109
So if we run that now, gone.

118
00:06:14.109 --> 00:06:14.942
Okay.

119
00:06:15.811 --> 00:06:16.644
Vanished.

120
00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:23.262
Where is it, so it's completely gone, so that's a forced

121
00:06:23.262 --> 00:06:27.262
delete, and again notice it doesn't prompt me to

122
00:06:28.582 --> 00:06:31.249
ask if I'm sure I wanna do that.

123
00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:35.745
Now, you need to be careful with this kind of command,

124
00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:38.682
because "rm -rf" can get you into a little bit of trouble

125
00:06:38.682 --> 00:06:42.861
because it is so much like a sledgehammer

126
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:43.694
to a nail.

127
00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:49.146
I tweeted a couple of years ago now, "rm -rf ~"

128
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.470
and if you remember from the earlier chapters, tilde means

129
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.243
the home directory, so you could actually

130
00:06:56.243 --> 00:06:58.988
blow away your entire home directory, and I've been in a

131
00:06:58.988 --> 00:07:03.469
situation with perfectly competent colleagues accidentally

132
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:07.144
deleting core directories and realising

133
00:07:07.144 --> 00:07:09.621
they've got that rf command and it just

134
00:07:09.621 --> 00:07:12.193
gets rid of everything, and it doesn't

135
00:07:12.193 --> 00:07:14.426
ask it just goes as fast as it can.

136
00:07:14.426 --> 00:07:17.926
So be careful with that, use it sparingly,

137
00:07:18.922 --> 00:07:21.474
but you can use it to get rid of directories that have

138
00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.250
files inside them and you can't be bothered to do

139
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.689
every one individually.

140
00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:28.866
Equally if you happen to have the terminal handy, you know

141
00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:32.965
use the terminal if you feel safe, sorry, Finder handy, use

142
00:07:32.965 --> 00:07:36.131
Finder if you feel safer doing that.

143
00:07:36.131 --> 00:07:39.245
What I'm going to show you next is "What about files that

144
00:07:39.245 --> 00:07:41.401
you don't have permission to delete?".
