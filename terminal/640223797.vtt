00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:06.782
<v ->So there's a question of why would you use the terminal?</v>

2
00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:08.985
Now, it's a good question

3
00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.931
because when you look at this black screen,

4
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:12.849
there's very little there.

5
00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:14.694
It's very unintuitive.

6
00:00:14.694 --> 00:00:16.921
It's not particularly user friendly.

7
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:21.257
But it's survived a good couple of decades worth of usage

8
00:00:21.257 --> 00:00:24.952
and it's still driving a lot of the computers

9
00:00:24.952 --> 00:00:28.417
that we have now and even Windows in the last year

10
00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:30.704
has landed a Bash shell.

11
00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:34.037
So this thing, the same terminal access.

12
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.126
So, why would you use this over something else?

13
00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:44.900
Now, the thing about something else is

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.989
you've got a browser to browse websites,

15
00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.156
you maybe have some Photoshop to do image manipulation,

16
00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:56.917
you might use, I don't know, like some text editors

17
00:00:56.917 --> 00:00:59.834
to do text manipulation or writing.

18
00:01:00.953 --> 00:01:02.370
But the terminal,

19
00:01:05.124 --> 00:01:07.048
you can use all of these,

20
00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:10.573
you can use lots of different programmes from the terminal.

21
00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:12.106
So terminal is just a way in.

22
00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:15.478
We have lots and lots of programmes inside of the terminal,

23
00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:18.710
or available to us in the terminal.

24
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.696
Some very, very low level kind of fundamental programmes,

25
00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:25.856
like we have a file called cat, a programme called cat, sorry,

26
00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:29.439
which will just take the contents of a file

27
00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.402
and put it on the screen.

28
00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:37.915
We have things like ls, which will do a directory listing.

29
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:40.455
We have du, which means disc usage.

30
00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:44.392
So I can see how much disc usage is being used

31
00:01:44.392 --> 00:01:46.475
by all these directories.

32
00:01:50.163 --> 00:01:52.286
We've got disc space,

33
00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:53.962
again not intuitive to look at,

34
00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:57.851
but once you, you can combine all of these tools,

35
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.580
and something that I might do quite frequently

36
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.026
is I will be, I'll take a very big log file, for instance,

37
00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:07.259
and I'll just want to get maybe

38
00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.999
how many times someone requested one particular file.

39
00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.117
Now I can open that in something like Sublime

40
00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:15.472
or Atom and count how many times

41
00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:17.599
a particular string occurs,

42
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.716
but it's very easy for me to go to the terminal

43
00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:23.049
and I can cat that file out,

44
00:02:24.628 --> 00:02:28.002
so I just start kind of echoing the contents

45
00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:29.570
of the file out to the screen,

46
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.704
and then I can run it through another programme

47
00:02:31.704 --> 00:02:34.577
called grep, which will find the occurrences

48
00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:37.659
of the string I'm looking for and only print those,

49
00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.282
and then I can pipe that into another programme,

50
00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:42.080
I can take the output from grep

51
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.485
and put that into another programme called unique

52
00:02:44.485 --> 00:02:47.633
and that will give me the number of unique counts

53
00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.883
for that particular string.

54
00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:54.300
All from the command line in just a couple of commands

55
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.601
just kind of mashing them together.

56
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:58.125
So it's very powerful for that kind of thing.

57
00:02:58.125 --> 00:02:59.785
And I'm sure you've come across tutorials,

58
00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:01.963
which are just open the terminal,

59
00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:03.293
go ahead and instal this.

60
00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:05.457
And we'll look at how to instal programmes

61
00:03:05.457 --> 00:03:07.790
in one of the later videos.
