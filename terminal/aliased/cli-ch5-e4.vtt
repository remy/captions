00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:04.489
<v ->Next we're gonna look at further customization</v>

2
00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:06.648
and more advanced customization through the use

3
00:00:06.648 --> 00:00:08.441
of something called Z Shell.

4
00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:11.377
Now, before you were running bash,

5
00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:15.544
and you can tell partly by its plain look, but also

6
00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:19.717
the title bar of the terminal says bash.

7
00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:23.800
And Z Shell is a different type of shell programme.

8
00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:30.127
You have bash, fish is one of them that we saw earlier.

9
00:00:30.127 --> 00:00:33.198
And Z Shell just gives us a bunch of extra features,

10
00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:36.508
and I was introduced to it a few years ago,

11
00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:40.390
and I really like it, I really like some of the plugins

12
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.376
that are available and the ecosystem that's out there.

13
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.360
And I know many other developers are using it as well,

14
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.706
so I wanted to introduce it in these videos.

15
00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:53.879
Now, the Z Shell page, don't worry, you don't have to

16
00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.546
go here, but it's not particularly inviting,

17
00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:01.360
but I just wanted to bring it in for the context.

18
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.707
Really, what we're interested in is this

19
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:06.263 line:15% 
kind of layer on top.

20
00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.859 line:15% 
There's a framework on top of Z Shell

21
00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.276 line:15% 
to help us configure it called Oh My Zsh.

22
00:01:15.602 --> 00:01:18.852 line:15% 
I'm not sure how to pronounce Zsh, Zsh?

23
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.099
It's pretty straightforward to instal.

24
00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.103
I'll come onto that in a moment.

25
00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.759
And what it'll give us is themes,

26
00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.619
a way to add plugins really easily,

27
00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.702
and a bunch of stuff that just makes,

28
00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:38.786
certainly for me, makes my terminal experience

29
00:01:38.786 --> 00:01:42.485
much more satisfying, so I wanna show you that as well.

30
00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:44.690
So the first thing we need to do

31
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.612
is instal Z Shell, but we're also gonna instal

32
00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:51.144
something called Z Shell completions,

33
00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.954
which we'll use to help us navigate around,

34
00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:58.019
and we're gonna use brew to do the installation of this.

35
00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:01.205
If you haven't got brew, go back to the

36
00:02:01.205 --> 00:02:04.427
second series of videos and grab brew.

37
00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:07.895
So Z Shell is just, brew instal zsh

38
00:02:07.895 --> 00:02:09.978
and then zsh-completions.

39
00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.436
I believe that's right, yup.

40
00:02:13.436 --> 00:02:15.436
So you run those two commands,

41
00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.564
it should go ahead and prompt to you for disc space

42
00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:20.388
and so on, you say yes and instal those two.

43
00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:22.516
Now, I've already done that.

44
00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:24.108
Now you can check that's been installed

45
00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:26.551
by just typing zsh Enter, you might get

46
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.920
a slightly different prompt, but it should just run.

47
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.101
I'm just gonna back out of that,

48
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:33.850
and to back out of the terminal is Ctrl + D.

49
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.933
That will always exit out of a shell.

50
00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.414
The next thing we wanna do, or I wanna do,

51
00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:44.497
instal Oh My Zsh, so I'm just gonna scroll down,

52
00:02:46.305 --> 00:02:49.085
prerequisites are the operating system,

53
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.061
that works very well on macOS.

54
00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:54.390
Zsh which we've just installed,

55
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.737
we can check again, zsh --version.

56
00:02:57.737 --> 00:02:59.982
So we have that, great.

57
00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:03.173
Curl or wget, if you find you don't have curl

58
00:03:03.173 --> 00:03:07.173
or wget installed, we do a quick check with this

59
00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:10.771
and wget --version.

60
00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:14.003
You can go ahead and do a brew instal curl,

61
00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:15.514
it'll give you curl.

62
00:03:15.514 --> 00:03:18.702
And then we're gonna do a copy and paste drop here.

63
00:03:18.702 --> 00:03:21.452
So I'm gonna copy and paste this.

64
00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:25.295 line:15% 
A note about security here.

65
00:03:25.295 --> 00:03:29.462 line:15% 
This is basically grabbing a script from online somewhere

66
00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.911 line:15% 
on the Internet, and running it on your local machine,

67
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.828 line:15% 
you should have a mind on security.

68
00:03:37.703 --> 00:03:41.822
Now, I've already installed this, I trust this script.

69
00:03:41.822 --> 00:03:44.800
I can also, honestly, I haven't looked at the contents

70
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.967
in detail, certainly recently, but there's nothing stopping

71
00:03:50.067 --> 00:03:51.989
the owner of this repo putting something malicious

72
00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.826
in this script, it's kind of like putting a script tag

73
00:03:55.826 --> 00:03:59.625
on your web page to anyone's web server

74
00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:03.493
and hoping they give you something that's nice,

75
00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.623
a decent advert instead of one that tracks

76
00:04:05.623 --> 00:04:07.990
every keyboard press on the page.

77
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.157
And you can see it's also prompting me for my password,

78
00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:15.049
which I'm gonna give it because

79
00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.543
it needs to do the installation.

80
00:04:17.543 --> 00:04:19.134
But just be wary of doing that,

81
00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.599
the same way as you would be if you were installing

82
00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:24.149
a third party piece of code or programme

83
00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:26.637
on your computer or on your phone or anything like that.

84
00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:29.176
So just be wary when you're asked to do

85
00:04:29.176 --> 00:04:31.461
this kind of copy and paste shell,

86
00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:35.833
it's basically saying run the contents of this script

87
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:39.508
in my shell, now I can go ahead and look at this URL,

88
00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:42.425
put it in the browser if I want to.

89
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.704
It isn't particularly intuitive, what I'm reading,

90
00:04:49.704 --> 00:04:53.371
I do know I've run it before and it is safe.

91
00:04:55.663 --> 00:04:58.891
Caveats aside, we have changed shell.

92
00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:01.672
So it says Oh My Zsh is now installed,

93
00:05:01.672 --> 00:05:05.839
please look over .zshrc or Z Shell RC to select plugins,

94
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:09.814
and we'll look at that in a moment.

95
00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:10.919
Get some stickers and so on.

96
00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.221
You can see the prompt's slightly different now,

97
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:15.695
so we bring up to the top and just do an ls -ltr.

98
00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:17.042
You can see things are very slightly different

99
00:05:17.042 --> 00:05:18.801
to what we saw before.

100
00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:23.266
So we've got bold and colours going on for directories.

101
00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:26.766
We've got non-bold text for regular files.

102
00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:30.497
If I go into, I think it's Documents,

103
00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:34.178
and I'm hitting Tab for completion.

104
00:05:34.178 --> 00:05:36.266
And I just hit Tab again there and it gives me

105
00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:40.721
all of the arguments to ls, which is pretty useful.

106
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:42.803
We saw this with fish as well.

107
00:05:42.803 --> 00:05:46.970
So I can do the same thing, we go into jsonbin, oh.

108
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.114
There, sorry, typo.

109
00:05:52.114 --> 00:05:54.355
And you can see something going on here as well,

110
00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:55.910
so let me just clear the prompt.

111
00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.244
You can see the prompt has changed slightly.

112
00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:00.487
So we can see it's a git repo,

113
00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:02.816
and we're in the branch master.

114
00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:06.576
And if I, let me make a very quick change

115
00:06:06.576 --> 00:06:08.159
to the README file.

116
00:06:11.518 --> 00:06:13.111
And you can see this little cross,

117
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:15.843
it means that the repository is dirty,

118
00:06:15.843 --> 00:06:19.887
i.e. there is a local change somewhere here.

119
00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:21.071
And I can see, yeah, there we go.

120
00:06:21.071 --> 00:06:24.745
Git status shows me that the README has been modified,

121
00:06:24.745 --> 00:06:26.955
and that's what that little cross shows me.

122
00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:28.018
And if I don't have the cross,

123
00:06:28.018 --> 00:06:30.836
it means that the repo is clean.

124
00:06:30.836 --> 00:06:33.703
So out of the box, there's some useful functionality

125
00:06:33.703 --> 00:06:35.120
in the Oh My Zsh.

126
00:06:36.361 --> 00:06:39.508
We go back to the home directory.

127
00:06:39.508 --> 00:06:42.165
Earlier on, if we scroll back,

128
00:06:42.165 --> 00:06:45.351 line:15% 
I can see that it said look over this file,

129
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.972 line:15% 
so if we go ahead and just type open and that file name,

130
00:06:49.972 --> 00:06:54.542 line:15% 
and it's gonna open that into a text editor for me.

131
00:06:54.542 --> 00:06:56.341 line:15% 
Just bumping the font up here.

132
00:06:56.341 --> 00:06:58.551 line:15% 
So it's mostly comments,

133
00:06:58.551 --> 00:06:59.939 line:15% 
this obviously isn't syntax highlighted,

134
00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:02.600 line:15% 
I could open something like Sublime.

135
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.664
Everything starting with a hash is a comment,

136
00:07:05.664 --> 00:07:09.247
and this is the configuration for my shell.

137
00:07:10.353 --> 00:07:12.067
Now, the interesting thing, or the very first thing

138
00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:14.391
I'm interested in, is this.

139
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:16.877
There is also local customizations in this,

140
00:07:16.877 --> 00:07:18.473
we'll come back to that later.

141
00:07:18.473 --> 00:07:20.878
The Z Shell theme is robbyrussell.

142
00:07:20.878 --> 00:07:23.003
We can look at all the themes over here,

143
00:07:23.003 --> 00:07:26.231
so let's just stick that into a browser window,

144
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:30.395
and look at all the options we have in their glory.

145
00:07:30.395 --> 00:07:32.521
So lots and lots of screenshots,

146
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:34.810
so this is the one that I personally use,

147
00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.259
with a few modifications, but there are lots.

148
00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:41.876
As you can see, as you scroll through,

149
00:07:41.876 --> 00:07:44.626
we can just choose one at random.

150
00:07:46.242 --> 00:07:49.347
Or maybe not at random but should we choose one?

151
00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:52.291
Choose the agnoster one, that's quite a cool one,

152
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:54.656
so let's grab that.

153
00:07:54.656 --> 00:07:58.042
It says shown with Solarized Dark colorscheme

154
00:07:58.042 --> 00:08:01.209
and Powerline-patched Menlo 14 points,

155
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:06.294
so it talks about how to instal those fonts.

156
00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:09.073
Let's not do that one 'cause you need an extra font.

157
00:08:09.073 --> 00:08:12.240
Let's do, oh, we need to go Powerline.

158
00:08:14.838 --> 00:08:16.088
How about avit?

159
00:08:18.264 --> 00:08:21.164
There we go, just telling me to get on with it, choose one.

160
00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:23.747
So let's stick that into there,

161
00:08:25.131 --> 00:08:28.069
I'm just gonna hit Command + S, and that's saved.

162
00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:30.765
And if I just open up another tab,

163
00:08:30.765 --> 00:08:33.630
we can see slightly different configuration.

164
00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.821
I think the background colour isn't the same,

165
00:08:36.821 --> 00:08:39.488
but we would have to change that

166
00:08:41.244 --> 00:08:43.648
in the iTerm preferences over here.

167
00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:47.815
We just go back to the Documents and the jsonbin thing.

168
00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:52.802
We can see, oh, look, (mumbles) there, so three hours,

169
00:08:52.802 --> 00:08:57.089
I guess that was the last commit, maybe, git log.

170
00:08:57.089 --> 00:08:59.945
Kind of three hours ago, I think so, yup.

171
00:08:59.945 --> 00:09:01.376
So 3 hours 45 minutes ago was

172
00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:03.952
the last commit in this repo.

173
00:09:03.952 --> 00:09:06.203
Nice useful feature, as we can see, again,

174
00:09:06.203 --> 00:09:10.456
we have another cross telling us that we have a dirty repo.

175
00:09:10.456 --> 00:09:13.488
We have the branch that we're on and the directory,

176
00:09:13.488 --> 00:09:15.861
and we have our prompt a little bit low down.

177
00:09:15.861 --> 00:09:18.694
Pretty nice, what else do we have?

178
00:09:20.196 --> 00:09:22.644
Colour coded stuff here.

179
00:09:22.644 --> 00:09:24.811
And I wonder if we have...

180
00:09:25.828 --> 00:09:28.320
Let's go back to our home directory,

181
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.153
and I remember we had,

182
00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:35.352
in this bin, yeah, we had a programme that would execute,

183
00:09:36.577 --> 00:09:40.134
so it's called ./bin/hello would print out hello world.

184
00:09:40.134 --> 00:09:42.826
We see it's red, red means it's executable.

185
00:09:42.826 --> 00:09:44.622
So we've got these white files,

186
00:09:44.622 --> 00:09:47.653
which are just plain text, blue directories,

187
00:09:47.653 --> 00:09:49.614
and red means executable.

188
00:09:49.614 --> 00:09:52.185
So that's a theme, you can choose any one of the themes

189
00:09:52.185 --> 00:09:54.270
and literally just drop in the name

190
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.770
and then hit save and reload, and you have

191
00:09:58.921 --> 00:10:00.763
the theme automatically available.

192
00:10:00.763 --> 00:10:04.124
You can also edit themes, I have a blog post

193
00:10:04.124 --> 00:10:06.732
about how I've customised my theme,

194
00:10:06.732 --> 00:10:08.161
and in the next videos, I'll show you some plugins

195
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:10.494
I find really really useful.
