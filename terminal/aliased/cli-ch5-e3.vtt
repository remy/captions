<v ->Now following on from</v>

2
00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:07.480
customization of colours

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.641
iTerm also has a lot of themes available.

4
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:12.493
If we just go to the Preferences

5
00:00:12.493 --> 00:00:14.352
and go to the Profiles

6
00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:18.487
in Colours and you can select Colour Presets.

7
00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:20.447
Now there's not lot there in the first place.

8
00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:22.621
You can change them and get an idea what they look like

9
00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:24.413
so Solarized Dark.

10
00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:25.746
Solarized Light.

11
00:00:26.855 --> 00:00:28.527
There's not many there but

12
00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.546
also there is this Visit Online Gallery.

13
00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:32.418
So we go to this.

14
00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:34.770
So here's the iTerm gallery

15
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.520
that is in the iTerm application.

16
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:40.471
I've gone ahead and download the zip

17
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:42.212
which has all of the themes.

18
00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:43.625
You can scroll through

19
00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.647
and get an idea of the types of colours that are available.

20
00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:48.814
So maybe Adventure Time is your thing.

21
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:52.758
And you like Adventure Time

22
00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:54.385
and you wanna use these colours.

23
00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:56.480
There are a lot of other themes

24
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.708
but let's just go with that for the moment.

25
00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:01.484
So let's go back to iTerm.

26
00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:04.150
From the dropdown we're gonna do Import

27
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.276
and we're gonna go off to where I downloaded themes.

28
00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:09.359
And inside of

29
00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.264
I think it was themes? Schemes?

30
00:01:13.264 --> 00:01:14.347
Yup. Schemes.

31
00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:17.851
You'll find Adventure Time there it is.

32
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.350
Open

33
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.848
and that should be it.

34
00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.012
Oh no. Import.

35
00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:24.520
That's Time, there we go.

36
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.353
Cool.

37
00:01:25.353 --> 00:01:28.020
So that is now my default colour.

38
00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:30.266
Pretty crazy.

39
00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:33.500
That's it it's mercy just purple.

40
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.668
But that's pretty cool.

41
00:01:34.668 --> 00:01:37.000
So if you wanna give a bit of colour

42
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.811
and check out Preferences

43
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:40.811
Profiles not Appearances

44
00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.090
and then Colours

45
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.662
and then just go ahead and browse

46
00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:47.221
the iTerm colour selection.

47
00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:49.804
There are literally a hundreds.
