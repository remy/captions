<v ->Now you've already seen one of the</v>

2
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.154
cd shortcuts.

3
00:00:10.154 --> 00:00:12.643
You've seen cd ~, which takes you back

4
00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:13.996
to the home directory.

5
00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:15.579
I can also use cd -

6
00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.677
and what cd - does is take me back

7
00:00:20.677 --> 00:00:23.501
to the directory I was in a moment ago.

8
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:26.634
So, in this previous line, I was in the blog directory,

9
00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:29.857
and I typed in, I went up into the parent directory,

10
00:00:29.857 --> 00:00:31.139
into draughts.

11
00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:35.306
If I type in cd -, I go back into the blog directory.

12
00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.394
And equally, I can use that again

13
00:00:37.394 --> 00:00:39.155
to back to the draughts.

14
00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:40.035
Now, this is handy for

15
00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:41.690
jumping back and forth between directories

16
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.162
when I'm making copy changes here and there.

17
00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:47.834
Maybe I want to count the number of blog posts I have,

18
00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.855
and then I want to count the number of draughts I have.

19
00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:51.656
So, we can do that,

20
00:00:51.656 --> 00:00:54.156
ls and then I count all those.

21
00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:58.817
And then I cd back, and I do an ls

22
00:00:58.817 --> 00:00:59.827
and I count all those.

23
00:00:59.827 --> 00:01:03.250
I'll show you how to count and mix commands together

24
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.750
in a later video.
