<v ->So there's one last question.</v>

2
00:00:05.146 --> 00:00:07.646
Which of these should you use?

3
00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:11.962
Now there's no black and white answer, really.

4
00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:14.757
There's no one system that's better than the rest.

5
00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:16.968
Like I said, from my experience,

6
00:00:16.968 --> 00:00:20.512
I've had trouble with Python and Ruby,

7
00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:23.952
but also I know JavaScript, I understand how that works,

8
00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:27.584
and I'm gonna tend towards using MPM.

9
00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:30.056
I like MPM because it works the same

10
00:00:30.056 --> 00:00:32.389
on a Mac, Windows and Linux.

11
00:00:33.695 --> 00:00:35.105
And if I'm running any workshops,

12
00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:36.620
or if I'm going in to work with a company,

13
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.359
I know that it will instal nearly all the time,

14
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.440
99% of the time, across all three of those platforms.

15
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.357
Brew only exists on Mac

16
00:00:47.586 --> 00:00:49.660
and it has equivalents on other systems,

17
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.308
like apt-get for Linux,

18
00:00:52.308 --> 00:00:55.410
and there's like this Chocolatey,

19
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.208
I think it's called Chocolatey or something like that,

20
00:00:57.208 --> 00:00:58.208
for Windows.

21
00:00:59.348 --> 00:01:02.274
And Gems, really, I don't know enough about Ruby to say.

22
00:01:02.274 --> 00:01:04.313
So, part of it is kinda personal preference

23
00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:07.885
and part of it is just where the programmes are.

24
00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:11.388
And kind of where your information comes from.

25
00:01:11.388 --> 00:01:15.471
So I'm connected to a JavaScript-heavy community,

26
00:01:17.122 --> 00:01:19.316
so I hear more about programmes

27
00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:21.851
that are inside the MPM repository,

28
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:25.294
rather than the Ruby Gems repository.

29
00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:28.551
So, I wouldn't say one is better than the other,

30
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.715
that you should just only use one.

31
00:01:29.715 --> 00:01:33.089
I definitely recommend having at least Brew installed.

32
00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:36.339
And personally recommend installing MPM

33
00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:39.883
because it's my jam.

34
00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:45.324
But otherwise there's no one that's better than the rest.

35
00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:49.082
You know, it's whatever tool works for you, really.

36
00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:52.840
So, yeah like I said, I recommend installing them all,

37
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.962
using them all, and just installing what you need.

38
00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.849
Try and go back and kind of look at what you have installed

39
00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.013
and try and get rid of the things that you're not using

40
00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:03.051
if you don't use them,

41
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:05.376
because when you go to upgrade to another machine,

42
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:09.234
you want to probably bring along those tools with you.

43
00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:10.557
So it's worth kind of keeping track

44
00:02:10.557 --> 00:02:12.505
as to what you're actually using.
