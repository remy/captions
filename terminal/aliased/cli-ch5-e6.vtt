00:00:02.137 --> 00:00:04.703
<v ->So, in this last part of customising our shell,</v>

2
00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:06.499
I want to show you aliases.

3
00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.123
Aliases are effectively just shortcuts, shortcut commands

4
00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:12.815
that you can customise as you please.

5
00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:15.648
So, you see me type ls -ltr a lot,

6
00:00:16.892 --> 00:00:21.415
it's muscle memory, but it's quite a lengthy command,

7
00:00:21.415 --> 00:00:24.386
and it'd be great if I could just type ll.

8
00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:28.379
Now, you can see from the Z Shell highlighting,

9
00:00:28.379 --> 00:00:31.106
ll isn't a command, it's red,

10
00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:32.818
so if I run it, nothing's going to happen.

11
00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:36.901
So, what I want to do is alias ll to run ls -ltr,

12
00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:43.210
and the way that we do this is we can just do...

13
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.690
I'll show you arbitrarily on the command line,

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.302
but I'll show you how to configure your shell

15
00:00:48.302 --> 00:00:50.508
so that every time you open a new session,

16
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:52.138
that shortcut is there.

17
00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:56.305
So, what we do is alias ll='ls -ltr', and that's it.

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.883
Okay, I hit enter, and that now has aliased the

19
00:01:03.883 --> 00:01:07.101
ll command, and if I type it, you can see it's green now,

20
00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:09.829
I run it and it runs my shortcut,

21
00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.804
and it just makes it a little bit easier to type out.

22
00:01:12.804 --> 00:01:15.861
I should note that if you're using Z Shell

23
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:18.664
and possibly Fish, there're a whole bunch of aliases

24
00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:20.168
already set up for you,

25
00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:24.335
and I've just got this on Google, so Google's cheatsheet,

26
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:29.552
sorry, Z Shell's cheatsheet, the oh-my-zsh, specifically,

27
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.738
has a whole bunch of aliases already set up,

28
00:01:33.738 --> 00:01:36.021
and I've kind of undone a couple of them just so I can

29
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.708
show you how they work.

30
00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:42.212
And I think the ll one is already in there under

31
00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:43.462
something else.

32
00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:47.559
Well, I know it is because I removed it,

33
00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:50.611
the point being, if you have Z Shell, you will be able

34
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.261
to run ll and it will give you an output.

35
00:01:53.261 --> 00:01:54.733
It won't match this, and you can overwrite it

36
00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:56.734
and I'll show you that in a moment.

37
00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.177
But, the thing I want to show you now is that

38
00:01:59.177 --> 00:02:00.440
we have in this session,

39
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.596
when I open up another session, I type ll, it's red

40
00:02:02.596 --> 00:02:06.679
because this session doesn't know about my alias.

41
00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:11.245
So, what we have to do now is make sure that the alias

42
00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:14.342
is configured every single time.

43
00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:17.675
So, if you remember from previous video,

44
00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:23.321
we have a Z Shell rc file, and we're going to edit

45
00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:25.169
that file.

46
00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:30.791
So, by putting the alias inside of here,

47
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:34.583
it means that it'll always include our alias

48
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:37.067
in every single shell we ever open.

49
00:02:37.067 --> 00:02:40.735
So, I can just put the alias command directly in here,

50
00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:42.318
ll = 'ls -ltr'

51
00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:50.226
and if I hit save, now, when I open up a new session,

52
00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:52.017
that shortcut should be there,

53
00:02:52.017 --> 00:02:54.100
so let's go ahead and close our previous session,

54
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.566
open up a new one...

55
00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:58.816
ll, no spaces, I think, let's try that.

56
00:03:07.018 --> 00:03:09.960
And we have it in each session, brilliant.

57
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.293
And so the one thing I want to extend is

58
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.070
we can also put this into its own file

59
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.025
rather than adding it into our main config file

60
00:03:20.025 --> 00:03:21.862
we can manage it separately,

61
00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:23.535
that's fairly typical and it's the kind of thing

62
00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:25.571
I use in my own dot files as well.

63
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:27.895
So, if we just open up a new file,

64
00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:32.062
let's save this as .aliases, pretty common filename

65
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.808
for this, and I notice that sublime has renamed this

66
00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:43.708
to .sh, which I don't want, but it'll have to

67
00:03:44.606 --> 00:03:48.482
do for now, and we're gonna use the same syntax here,

68
00:03:48.482 --> 00:03:51.482
source, users, rem, and .aliases.sh.

69
00:03:55.654 --> 00:03:58.102
Now, if we open up a new terminal window,

70
00:03:58.102 --> 00:04:00.707
ll still works, but it also means that we can manage

71
00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:03.029
all our aliases inside of one window,

72
00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:04.866
inside of one file, rather,

73
00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:06.412
and that way I can kind of back it up

74
00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:09.308
and put it in the git repo and make sure that when I

75
00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:12.282
get a new machine, I have all my aliases in one go,

76
00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:15.583
it means that if I switch to Fish, for instance,

77
00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:18.032
I can just bring my aliases separately

78
00:04:18.032 --> 00:04:21.826
and so, other ones I might want is ps, and I type in

79
00:04:21.826 --> 00:04:25.326
ps auxww all the time, so let's have that.

80
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.946
There are aliases like this, so you can put

81
00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:32.863
three dots equals cd...

82
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.344
Like that, and, like I said, Z Shell definitely

83
00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:39.504
sets this one up for you, so you don't particularly

84
00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:42.495
need it, but it's pretty handy if you have your

85
00:04:42.495 --> 00:04:45.843
own kind of shell, you can also keep going with this,

86
00:04:45.843 --> 00:04:49.998
which means that if you open up a new shell

87
00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.331
and you go into documents, remy, public,

88
00:04:56.358 --> 00:05:00.525
I can type three dots and it will go up to documents,

89
00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:05.168
I think, yeah.

90
00:05:05.168 --> 00:05:08.145
A really nice way of kind of shortcutting how we

91
00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:10.509
see back and forth.

92
00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.828
And there's kind of endless possibilities,

93
00:05:12.828 --> 00:05:15.150
you find yourself typing something quite often,

94
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.551
just stick it in alias and the job is done.

95
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:21.718
One I use all the time is gs, and that's my git status,

96
00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:28.473
and it's something I've just got, and I'll just type gs

97
00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:30.020
and hit enter and it gives me the git status

98
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.776
for a project.

99
00:05:31.776 --> 00:05:34.711
So, yeah, aliases, and the extension of that is

100
00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:37.481
functions, which work similarly to aliases,

101
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:40.046
but allow you to kind of write shell scripting

102
00:05:40.046 --> 00:05:41.514
to make it a bit more complicated,

103
00:05:41.514 --> 00:05:42.894
so we'll look at those next.
