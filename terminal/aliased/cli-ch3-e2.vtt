<v ->Okay, so I'm gonna reintroduce you</v>

2
00:00:03.073 --> 00:00:05.990
to two very simple string commands.

3
00:00:09.772 --> 00:00:11.076
Both you've already met.

4
00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:12.552
Echo is one.

5
00:00:12.552 --> 00:00:14.905
So echo can do strings

6
00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:17.894
and all it does is take the argument

7
00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:20.227
and echo it onto the output.

8
00:00:21.302 --> 00:00:23.960
But this is useful for then piping

9
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.903
something else like say.

10
00:00:25.903 --> 00:00:27.235
<v Computer Voice>Remy.</v>

11
00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.454
<v ->I'm not sure how my computer pronounces my name,</v>

12
00:00:29.454 --> 00:00:32.619
but we can echo that out to,

13
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.194
we can pipe that into say,

14
00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:37.287
and say, well read out that whole thing.

15
00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.450
So if we want to freak out our friends,

16
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.200
hello I am a computer, and so on.

17
00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:46.436
And cat, the typical use for cat

18
00:00:46.436 --> 00:00:48.940
is to take the contents of a file

19
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.023
and put it on the screen.

20
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.094
So if I take one of my blog posts,

21
00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:56.844
my-2013 for instance,

22
00:00:57.811 --> 00:00:59.822
that'll take the contents of that file

23
00:00:59.822 --> 00:01:01.940
and just print it to the screen.

24
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.519
From there, if I wanted to, I could do a count.

25
00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.102
I could say it all.

26
00:01:09.264 --> 00:01:12.852
Probably a bit dull, but I could say it.

27
00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:14.857
I could do other things with that as well.

28
00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:18.774
But once we can cat out the contents of a file,

29
00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:21.835
there's lots of other things we can do with it,

30
00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.395
which we will see in the next video.

31
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:26.409
So those two very basic commands,

32
00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.326
useful for just getting content out

33
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.091
to send it out to them,

34
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:33.508
feed into another programme.
