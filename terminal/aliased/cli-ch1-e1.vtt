<v ->Welcome to my video series on the Command Line.</v>

2
00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:11.374
Now this video series is really designed for

3
00:00:11.374 --> 00:00:13.665
either if you're a developer that's very new

4
00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.953
to using Command Line, or maybe a designer

5
00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:17.812
that needs to use Command Line,

6
00:00:17.812 --> 00:00:20.992
generally kind of frontend web folk

7
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:22.823
who know they have to use Command Line

8
00:00:22.823 --> 00:00:24.951
kind of dip in every now and then.

9
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.573
Don't really like the whole area or experience,

10
00:00:28.573 --> 00:00:29.819
they just want to get the job done.

11
00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.986
This series of videos compliments my A Book Apart book

12
00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:41.363
on the Command Line, but it just has some hands on things.

13
00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:46.829
I will show you actually what it looks like on the computer,

14
00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.150
and I'll be kind of holding your hand

15
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.567
throughout this whole series.

16
00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.950
I bought myself a brand new Mac here,

17
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.442
and the first thing is I want to open Command Line.

18
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:01.731
Now how many times have you gone to a tutorial

19
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:04.731
and it said, just open the Terminal.

20
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.434
How do you just open the Terminal?

21
00:01:09.434 --> 00:01:12.591
Well let's head off to Finder.

22
00:01:12.591 --> 00:01:14.165
Now obviously is you have Windows or Linux

23
00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:15.557
is slightly different.

24
00:01:15.557 --> 00:01:17.379
I have a separate video on that,

25
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.844
and if you go to Finder,

26
00:01:19.844 --> 00:01:21.985
really what they're referring to is

27
00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:23.663
the Terminal application.

28
00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:28.196
Now your find that in the Applications group,

29
00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:30.082
but it's not in this main group.

30
00:01:30.082 --> 00:01:32.778
You have to go ahead and go to Utilities,

31
00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:34.412
so down here.

32
00:01:34.412 --> 00:01:36.725
Every Mac comes with a folder called Utilities,

33
00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.169
and in there are a whole bunch of diagnostic programmes

34
00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:43.336
and tools, but also most interestingly

35
00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:47.307
is the Terminal.

36
00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.289
Now I'm gonna go ahead and drag that to my dock

37
00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.344
just to make it a little bit more reachable

38
00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:52.405
next time around.

39
00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:53.917
I'm gonna go ahead and click on it,

40
00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:56.699
so let's get rid of this and open the Terminal.

41
00:01:56.699 --> 00:01:58.421
Now that my Terminal is open,

42
00:01:58.421 --> 00:01:59.554
this is kind of the default view

43
00:01:59.554 --> 00:02:02.145
if you haven't made any changes.

44
00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:04.602
Not that friendly to be fair,

45
00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.076
but you have a white screen instead of a black screen

46
00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:11.368
which is Mac's way of trying to be a bit friendlier.

47
00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:13.924
We can resize the window to whatever we want,

48
00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:16.866
and also we can bump the font size up.

49
00:02:16.866 --> 00:02:19.244
I generally have the font a little bit bigger

50
00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:22.456
just because I like it on my eyes.

51
00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:25.539
Now this by itself isn't that useful.

52
00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.722
Now the default Terminal,

53
00:02:31.373 --> 00:02:33.823
the Mac revise is okay.

54
00:02:33.823 --> 00:02:37.990
It has tabs so for Command T I can get another tab.

55
00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:40.670
It has a few other features,

56
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.837
but there's a much better tool for working in the Terminal.

57
00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:50.068
Now the tool that's my preference

58
00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:51.229
is something called iTerm,

59
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.785
so I'm just going to show you that now.

60
00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:57.104
This is the iTerm website.

61
00:02:57.104 --> 00:02:59.197
It's a Terminal emulator,

62
00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:01.816
or a Terminal just like the Terminal application

63
00:03:01.816 --> 00:03:03.496
except it's called iTerm.

64
00:03:03.496 --> 00:03:05.303
It has a few more features that we'll be making use of,

65
00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:09.159
in particular you've got things like split screens

66
00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.690
and you can if you'd like animate gifs.

67
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.700
You can have 'em appear inside the Terminal as well.

68
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.388
We're going ahead and download that,

69
00:03:16.388 --> 00:03:17.811
and just put that down in my dock

70
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:19.644
like I have the Terminal programme,

71
00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:21.796
and we'll come back once that's down.
