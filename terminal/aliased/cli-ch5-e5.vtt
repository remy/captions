00:00:02.144 --> 00:00:03.418
<v ->So next up we're going to look up</v>

2
00:00:03.418 --> 00:00:05.618
how we can add plugins

3
00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:06.785
to our zshell.

4
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.461
or a particular oh-my zshell

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.402
and Oh-my zshell, makes it very, very easy

6
00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:16.305
to add in additional plug-ins.

7
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:17.138
So

8
00:00:18.335 --> 00:00:21.739
you can either google Oh-my zshell plugins

9
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:22.899
you should land on this page,

10
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.944 line:15% 
otherwise there'll be a link in the video that you can use.

11
00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:28.400 line:15% 
And the description is pretty straightforward.

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.524
You edit your .zhrc that we met earlier

13
00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:32.787
and there's a list of plugins

14
00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:33.770
which I'll show you in a moment

15
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.242
and you just add into that.

16
00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:38.211
Now what I do is I tend to browse down this long list.

17
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:41.082
Some of those don't make any sense to me at all.

18
00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:45.191
I don't use apache-macports or archlinux

19
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:48.015
But I do recognise words like bower and brew,

20
00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:49.432
bundler and cask.

21
00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.231
So there's a bunch of things in here.

22
00:00:52.231 --> 00:00:54.751
What I tend to do is just kinda scroll through these

23
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:56.433
and have a look a ones that catch my eye,

24
00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:59.402
like git-extras and so on.

25
00:00:59.402 --> 00:01:00.635
So there's git-hub there as well.

26
00:01:00.635 --> 00:01:04.558
If you scroll down a bit more, I think earlier I saw OSX.

27
00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:07.835
So when I click on that, have a read.

28
00:01:07.835 --> 00:01:10.603
Decide whether or not I wanna instal it

29
00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.474
and I'll show you how to instal it.

30
00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:16.203
So, our showfiles and hidefiles are really useful

31
00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:18.891
and maybe this is something I would instal.

32
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.361
But we're going to look at 'sublime'.

33
00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:23.249
So I use sublime for my editing

34
00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.332
and I wanna show you the plugin that it gives me.

35
00:01:28.424 --> 00:01:29.809
Really straightforward.

36
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:32.476
This command 'st' opens sublime.

37
00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:35.152
It can either open sublime

38
00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:38.462
or open sublime on a directory or a file.

39
00:01:38.462 --> 00:01:42.285
So I'm just gonna go ahead and copy the word sublime

40
00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:45.118
and I'm gonna open the .zhrc file.

41
00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.340
I can type it out again

42
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.300
but one of the really nice features of zshell

43
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.956
is I can start typing the beginning

44
00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:57.539
of the command I ran earlier on in history,

45
00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.905
if you remember history from one of the earlier videos

46
00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:04.122
but now I can just cursor up.

47
00:02:04.122 --> 00:02:07.530
Just doing cursor up says find me anything in the history

48
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.026
that begins with 'op',

49
00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.794
the first few characters I had just there, so 'op'.

50
00:02:11.794 --> 00:02:13.863
And if I just keep cursoring up,

51
00:02:13.863 --> 00:02:15.151
it'll show you the different things

52
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:16.840
that I've run with 'open.'

53
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.482
So I opened this directory earlier

54
00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:20.927
and I opened the .zshrc file.

55
00:02:20.927 --> 00:02:21.855
So I can just hit that

56
00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:25.599
and that's a real nice kinda little history hack.

57
00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.935
So if you search this file for plugin,

58
00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:33.150
plugins equals rather, it should just jump you to this area

59
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.182
and by default, we have a 'git' plugin,

60
00:02:35.182 --> 00:02:36.215
which is a thing that allowed us

61
00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.190
to see when we had dirty files

62
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.459
and what the repository was.

63
00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.698
I'm just going to put in 'sublime', hit save.

64
00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:47.315
Now saving doesn't reload my config in this shell.

65
00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:50.315
I have to either open up another terminal window

66
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:53.667
or I have to exit this one and go back into it.

67
00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:57.800
Or I can do a dot and I'll just do (inaudible) dollar

68
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.056
and dot will reload the file form as well.

69
00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:01.427
So you do whatever you want,

70
00:03:01.427 --> 00:03:04.971
but just bear in mind until you reload that shell

71
00:03:04.971 --> 00:03:08.099
you're not going to have that configuration change.

72
00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.931
So now, I should be able to type 'st'

73
00:03:11.931 --> 00:03:14.431
and choose directory like

74
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:16.264
'Documents', 'jsonbin'

75
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.573
and hit 'Enter' and it'll open up sublime in that directory.

76
00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:23.165
So I go ahead and make a change.

77
00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:25.827
I could do on a specific file

78
00:03:25.827 --> 00:03:27.698
and it will open up the README for me

79
00:03:27.698 --> 00:03:29.914
and it's the same as kind of,

80
00:03:29.914 --> 00:03:31.182
I use VI sometimes

81
00:03:31.182 --> 00:03:35.425
which is kind of Text Editor version here.

82
00:03:35.425 --> 00:03:38.976
But using 'sublime' to open up this is really handy.

83
00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:39.989
So yeah.

84
00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.274
Pretty cool.

85
00:03:41.274 --> 00:03:43.330
But that's just a short cut rig.

86
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.497
One of the plugins I find really, really useful is called z

87
00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:54.890
or 'z', depending on how you wanna pronounce it.

88
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.057
Scroll down to the bottom.

89
00:03:58.011 --> 00:04:00.178
It's not even there is it.

90
00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:02.934
I can't remember how I came unto it,

91
00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:05.653
so maybe this is like an inside tip

92
00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:06.653
and but z is

93
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:10.654
a way to quickly navigate

94
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.456
into different directories that you've been into recently.

95
00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:16.460
So if I instal that

96
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.326
and I just run that source command again.

97
00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:22.572
I should be able to type in 'z' and 'js'

98
00:04:22.572 --> 00:04:24.494
and it should jump me into.

99
00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:25.934
I think I need to populate the history.

100
00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:27.351
So if I move into

101
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.501
'Documents',

102
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:32.114
and 'jsonbin'

103
00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:41.105
It gave me an error just there.

104
00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:44.504
No such directory or file, '.z'.

105
00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:46.254
I think it has it now

106
00:04:47.884 --> 00:04:49.217
Okay it has one.

107
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:53.906
I'm just gonna go back into maybe 'Documents' and the 'remy'

108
00:04:53.906 --> 00:04:56.739
and I look at the public directory

109
00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:02.065
and from here, if I type 'z' and the 'json',

110
00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:04.607
what's gonna happen is, it's gonna search through my history

111
00:05:04.607 --> 00:05:06.208
of directories I've been into

112
00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:09.241
and it should jump me into the most recent one

113
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:11.129
that matches that strain.

114
00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.558
So it moves me into that directory link,

115
00:05:12.558 --> 00:05:15.612
you'll have to kinda navigate up and down.

116
00:05:15.612 --> 00:05:18.192
If I type in 'z rem',

117
00:05:18.192 --> 00:05:20.104
it should take me to remyshop.com

118
00:05:20.104 --> 00:05:22.521
but not the public directory.

119
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:25.184
And then finally what I wanna show you

120
00:05:25.184 --> 00:05:27.016
is zshell syntax highlighting.

121
00:05:27.016 --> 00:05:30.099
So again if you watch the fish video,

122
00:05:31.176 --> 00:05:33.133
you'll see that if we type a command wrong

123
00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.407
it comes up in red.

124
00:05:34.407 --> 00:05:36.837
And it's a really neat feature

125
00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.920
and I find really useful.

126
00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:43.124
We have to instal it manually.

127
00:05:43.124 --> 00:05:46.874
So I'll include the link to this in the video

128
00:05:49.344 --> 00:05:51.472
but we have to go ahead and instal this

129
00:05:51.472 --> 00:05:53.336
and here we go,

130
00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:54.253
to instal,

131
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.977
we clone the repo

132
00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:03.502
probably didn't want to put it there

133
00:06:03.502 --> 00:06:07.669
and let's move the zshell thingy into our home directory.

134
00:06:10.905 --> 00:06:11.871
Just make sure it's still there.

135
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:12.704
Yup

136
00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:16.371
and then next we're going to do this command

137
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.619
K, so now, there should be,

138
00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.536
it should have added a line to our zshell file.

139
00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.595
Let's just close that

140
00:06:28.595 --> 00:06:31.955
and open in again and down at the bottom

141
00:06:31.955 --> 00:06:35.060
you should see that's the lines being added.

142
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.636
I got it twice somehow

143
00:06:36.636 --> 00:06:39.174
and it's only because I was doing some

144
00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:41.136
preparation work earlier.

145
00:06:41.136 --> 00:06:43.496
So if I open up a new tab,

146
00:06:43.496 --> 00:06:48.259
now if I type, you can see I have a green text there

147
00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.995
and you can see if I type in something that doesn't exist

148
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:53.708
I get it red.

149
00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:56.164
And then if it's good then green.

150
00:06:56.164 --> 00:06:57.099
So that's cool.

151
00:06:57.099 --> 00:06:59.599
It means that also things like

152
00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:03.972
that directory doesn't exist

153
00:07:03.972 --> 00:07:06.604
and but when I type something, it does exist.

154
00:07:06.604 --> 00:07:08.148
You can see it's underlined.

155
00:07:08.148 --> 00:07:10.036
That's a really good visual cue

156
00:07:10.036 --> 00:07:14.088
that I'm correctly typing what I'm doing

157
00:07:14.088 --> 00:07:15.338
So, 'documents'

158
00:07:17.964 --> 00:07:18.797
'jsonbin'

159
00:07:19.847 --> 00:07:20.943
and if public,

160
00:07:20.943 --> 00:07:22.783
so you can move around really easily now

161
00:07:22.783 --> 00:07:26.079
And I can save from running commands incorrectly.

162
00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.770
So if it was you know 'fi' doesn't exist

163
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.136
I know that because it's not even highlight green

164
00:07:32.136 --> 00:07:34.719
but 'fish' does, 'fis' doesn't.

165
00:07:35.593 --> 00:07:36.426
I think that 'fi' actually means

166
00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:38.252
it's matching more than one thing.

167
00:07:38.252 --> 00:07:39.881
So I'm hitting tab here to work my way

168
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:41.774
through all these different things.

169
00:07:41.774 --> 00:07:44.357
So that was the last one there.

170
00:07:45.214 --> 00:07:48.342
Definitely worth scrolling through these plugins

171
00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:49.678
and having a look around.

172
00:07:49.678 --> 00:07:52.427
Look in the ecosystem, checking out stuff.

173
00:07:52.427 --> 00:07:54.038
Maybe use 'jira'.

174
00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:56.369
You can get a 'jira' plugin.

175
00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:58.119
No idea what that is.

176
00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:04.476
Maybe you'll wanna try and instal that next and find out.

177
00:08:04.476 --> 00:08:05.309
Great!

178
00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:09.755
So that is customising your shell experience

179
00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.437
and except the file that we've seen,

180
00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:16.437
everything lives inside of this doc .zshrc file.

181
00:08:17.349 --> 00:08:20.044
And if you save that and move it to another machine

182
00:08:20.044 --> 00:08:21.412
then that's your whole configuration

183
00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:23.388
and that's what will make it look

184
00:08:23.388 --> 00:08:26.223
and feel the way that you want it to look and feel.
