00:00:00.853 --> 00:00:02.961
<v ->So I know throughout this video series</v>

2
00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.714
that you've been watching if you occasionally

3
00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:06.922
got a glimpse of the ask it pony,

4
00:00:06.922 --> 00:00:08.963
I'm sure you're thinking how on earth

5
00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:11.630
do I get that on my own machine?

6
00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:15.290
You've come to the secret bonus video

7
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.518
that was probably just linked in the list.

8
00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.793
So on my mac I did brew instal pony say

9
00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:23.725
So on my mac I did brew instal pony say

10
00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:26.452
and I got a programme called pony say.

11
00:00:26.452 --> 00:00:27.285
And pony say stuff,

12
00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:29.260
And pony say stuff,

13
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.885
so pony say hello people.

14
00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.968
so pony say hello people.

15
00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:38.249
And I mean it's a turtle but you know we're getting there.

16
00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:39.646
Depending on the font you use,

17
00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:41.658
depending on the terminal you use,

18
00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:44.491
and it'll look slightly different.

19
00:00:46.082 --> 00:00:48.101
But maybe this is what you want

20
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:51.235
to welcome you every single time.

21
00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:52.068
I'm pretty sure there is pony say help.

22
00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:56.107
I'm pretty sure there is pony say help.

23
00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:58.524
I can list all of the ponies.

24
00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:02.099
Somewhere -l I think.

25
00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:03.191
Yeah, list.

26
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:05.108
So let's list them all,

27
00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:07.389
and let's do,

28
00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:09.192
and let's do,

29
00:01:09.192 --> 00:01:10.171
pinkie.

30
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:12.493
That's good enough for me.

31
00:01:12.493 --> 00:01:13.926
So pony say -f pinkie hello.

32
00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:16.259
So pony say -f pinkie hello.

33
00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:18.335
There you go.

34
00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:19.168
And most machines will come with a programme called fortune.

35
00:01:19.168 --> 00:01:23.593
And most machines will come with a programme called fortune.

36
00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:26.078
And this will just print out

37
00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:28.045
like a fortune cookie kind of thing.

38
00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:29.414
And you can pipe that to pony say - oh,

39
00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:33.610
And you can pipe that to pony say - oh,

40
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.543
pony say -f pinkie.

41
00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:36.602
pony say -f pinkie.

42
00:01:36.602 --> 00:01:37.593
And pinkie by, I think's her name will give you the fortune.

43
00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:42.245
And pinkie by, I think's her name will give you the fortune.

44
00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:44.007
And even better than that, you make that

45
00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.860
part of your start up shell, start up file.

46
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.085
So if you use z shell that'll be z shell rc.

47
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:52.752
So if you use z shell that'll be z shell rc.

48
00:01:54.207 --> 00:01:55.040
Shell rc.

49
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.873
Shell rc.

50
00:01:55.873 --> 00:01:57.206
Shell rc.

51
00:01:57.206 --> 00:01:58.039
Or bash rc, or whatever,

52
00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.039
Or bash rc, or whatever,

53
00:02:01.847 --> 00:02:04.104
whatever shell you're using rc

54
00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:04.937
and it runs that entire file as it boots up.

55
00:02:04.937 --> 00:02:09.039
and it runs that entire file as it boots up.

56
00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.652
And mine's got lots of bits in it, a few aliases

57
00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:14.021
that I've kind of accidentally put in there.

58
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:16.592
But here right towards the bottom,

59
00:02:16.592 --> 00:02:20.229
I have this command so let's just bump the font up for you.

60
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.778
So hash pony say kind of a weird command and pony say -o.

61
00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:25.778
So hash pony say kind of a weird command and pony say -o.

62
00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:27.612
And what this does is that every time

63
00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:29.879
I bring up a new terminal it

64
00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.542
will run firstly this hash part.

65
00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:35.737
Hash pony say redirect to dev null

66
00:02:35.737 --> 00:02:39.154
means if it exists then run this programme.

67
00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:41.635
I copied it from somewhere else,

68
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:45.258
I can't remember where but it definitely works.

69
00:02:45.258 --> 00:02:46.583
And if you know it's gonna be installed

70
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.184
than you don't need that part.

71
00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:49.017
<v ->o means no, it's quiet.</v>

72
00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:51.460
<v ->o means no, it's quiet.</v>

73
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.783
But I could easily change this to pony say cause

74
00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:57.166
and fortune, fortune pipe pony say, oops.

75
00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:00.775
and fortune, fortune pipe pony say, oops.

76
00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:04.187
And I'm just gonna save that, open up a new tab,

77
00:03:04.187 --> 00:03:05.145
and there you go.

78
00:03:05.145 --> 00:03:06.948
and there you go.

79
00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:11.072
There is the fortune told to me as per a pony.

80
00:03:11.072 --> 00:03:13.217
There's also a whole bunch of other ones like cow say.

81
00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:14.669
Cow say is a very popular one,

82
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.752
if you read the book cow say was the,

83
00:03:18.667 --> 00:03:20.546
oops I need to give it something.

84
00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:22.207
Okay, hi,

85
00:03:22.207 --> 00:03:23.040
hey.

86
00:03:24.656 --> 00:03:25.723
That's the aski art.

87
00:03:25.723 --> 00:03:29.029
There's a whole bunch of cow say

88
00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.304
different, cows?

89
00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:31.137
different, cows?

90
00:03:31.137 --> 00:03:32.562
different, cows?

91
00:03:32.562 --> 00:03:33.395
Nope.

92
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.170
Somewhere is usage.

93
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.552
I think maybe I've broken my version of cow say.

94
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:40.794
I'd have to reinstall it.

95
00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:41.627
Oh here we go.

96
00:03:41.627 --> 00:03:42.460
Surgery telebears three eyes.

97
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.877
Surgery telebears three eyes.

98
00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:49.029
Cow say -f three eyes.

99
00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.024
Cow say -f three eyes.

100
00:03:51.024 --> 00:03:51.857
Echo hey.

101
00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:55.647
Yep there you go, there's a cow with three eyes

102
00:03:55.647 --> 00:03:59.563
so you can put that command in your rc file

103
00:03:59.563 --> 00:04:01.609
and be greated by it

104
00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.398
every time you bring up a new tab.

105
00:04:03.398 --> 00:04:04.981
Me, I like my pony.

106
00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.012
And it's colourful.

107
00:04:09.012 --> 00:04:11.893
It basically brightens up a rather dull looking screen,

108
00:04:11.893 --> 00:04:13.167
which is what I like.
