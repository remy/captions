00:00:01.779 --> 00:00:04.410
<v ->During this series of Screencasts I focused entirely</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.908
on using a Mac.

3
00:00:05.908 --> 00:00:10.075
However, pretty much everything I've covered in this series

4
00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:14.409
of Screencasts and everything I will cover is supported

5
00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:16.705
on Windows as well and Linux

6
00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:20.157
but it's more likely that if you're not a Mac user,

7
00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:22.637
I believe you'll be a Windows user.

8
00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:26.387
Now there is BASH for Windows, it's very new.

9
00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:28.949
It's still kind of on the beta

10
00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.849
and you have to go through a bit of a process

11
00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.190
to actually turn it on

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.773
but it is supported by Windows.

13
00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:39.071 line:15% 
This is the URL, I will include a link in the video.

14
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.126 line:15% 
You have to just step through each one of these items

15
00:00:42.126 --> 00:00:46.293 line:15% 
and you go through slowly enabling all the features

16
00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:51.592
inside of Windows to get to this version of BASH.

17
00:00:51.592 --> 00:00:54.245
And once you have it, it's actually very complete.

18
00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.405
I haven't come across any problems yet

19
00:00:56.405 --> 00:00:57.927
in my kind of initial testing

20
00:00:57.927 --> 00:01:01.373
and everything that I have recorded in the Screencast

21
00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:06.133
is actually available in this copy of BASH basically.

22
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:08.979
So go ahead and instal everything here.

23
00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.463
The one difference is, there's no brew which is Mac specific

24
00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:15.323
but you do have apt-get update

25
00:01:15.323 --> 00:01:19.091
and that will be the way that you instal programmes

26
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:19.924
and so on.

27
00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:21.233
So I just want to show you a few things here.

28
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:25.400
So to run BASH,

29
00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:29.163
let's type in BASH.

30
00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:30.293
It's given me a few options here.

31
00:01:30.293 --> 00:01:34.724
One, I can either run BASH from this command line programme,

32
00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:38.224
I can also run it from the Command Prompt.

33
00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:41.692
So I can go to the Command Prompt, I can bash

34
00:01:41.692 --> 00:01:43.415
and it will drop into BASH for me

35
00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.431
or I can just go straight to, oops excuse me,

36
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:51.090
BASH and it will just launch pretty much the same window.

37
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.090
But you can see when I go into this,

38
00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:58.409
you can see a similar kind of, the same output

39
00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.576
that we would see with an LS on the Mac that I used earlier.

40
00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.737
So we have the permissions down here,

41
00:02:05.737 --> 00:02:09.570
we have some highlighting for the actual colour

42
00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:16.553
oops, keyboard shortcut's slightly different.

43
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:20.746
Yep, that's the home directory, I'm can go into foo

44
00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:24.036
and I can go back using shortcuts,

45
00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:26.270
which we saw in the early videos

46
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.437
and I've also created a bashrc file,

47
00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.264
I didn't create the bashrc file but I've created

48
00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:35.705
some aliases inside of it.

49
00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.527
If you see down here, I've added a couple of aliases

50
00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:41.193
just to say ".." is back up one directory

51
00:02:41.193 --> 00:02:44.039
and you can see that working if i go into foo,

52
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.124
I can type in "..", so that's one of my custom aliases.

53
00:02:48.124 --> 00:02:52.761
We have "ps" which we'll meet later on in the Screencast.

54
00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.373
Now there's not many programmes are running

55
00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.671
because we're running inside of,

56
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:00.222
I think it's kind of a virtual machine

57
00:03:00.222 --> 00:03:03.175
running inside of Windows so the only programmes

58
00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:04.887
that are running are actually the thing

59
00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:07.977
that booted this little machine,

60
00:03:07.977 --> 00:03:10.318
the bash instance and the ps that I just ran.

61
00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:11.946
But if I was running other processes inside of this

62
00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:14.829
like a no process or something like that

63
00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.216
I would see it listed here as well.

64
00:03:17.216 --> 00:03:21.299
To instal things I would do sudo apt-get instal

65
00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:25.353
and then the name of the programme so it may be git,

66
00:03:25.353 --> 00:03:29.886
or a node...

67
00:03:29.886 --> 00:03:32.567
or a cowsay for instance.

68
00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.338
And it'll ask me for my password

69
00:03:34.338 --> 00:03:37.031
and when you go ahead and instal BASH for the first time

70
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:41.101
it asks you to setup a user, so I've created remy

71
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:43.349
and I've got a standard password for that.

72
00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.885
And it's using the Linux kind of instal method

73
00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:49.552
to instal a cowsay.

74
00:03:51.172 --> 00:03:55.926
So, does it work, I think I have to echo something.

75
00:03:55.926 --> 00:03:57.093
"hi" | cowsay.

76
00:03:59.582 --> 00:04:03.565
Yeah, so we've got pipes going on here,

77
00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:06.751
pretty much exactly what I would expect.

78
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:10.934
Now there are a couple of, one small quirk I've noticed.

79
00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:12.561
This directory where I've got some files,

80
00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:15.199
maybe I've created an important file inside

81
00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.203
of this foo directory.

82
00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:18.465
Where is that?

83
00:04:18.465 --> 00:04:22.632
So if I touch this-is-my-file.txt

84
00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:28.649
and I can go to, the Windows Explorer

85
00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:32.816
and I can probably search for this-is-my-file.txt

86
00:04:38.014 --> 00:04:39.338
and it doesn't seem to find it.

87
00:04:39.338 --> 00:04:40.610
So it doesn't find it in the first place.

88
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.327
And actually finding this directory is a little tricky,

89
00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:49.097
so, excuse me, I'm not used to this virtual machine.

90
00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:53.659 line:15% 
You have to go into IEUser and by default kind

91
00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:56.124 line:15% 
of system folders and special folders are hidden

92
00:04:56.124 --> 00:04:58.707
so we have to show hidden items

93
00:04:59.937 --> 00:05:02.496
and I can go into AppData and then Local

94
00:05:02.496 --> 00:05:04.732
and inside of here it's hidden again.

95
00:05:04.732 --> 00:05:08.149
If I go to the settings and hidden files,

96
00:05:09.751 --> 00:05:11.668
and then scroll down to

97
00:05:14.223 --> 00:05:16.875
uncheck this box here where it says "Hide protected

98
00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:18.411
"operating system files."

99
00:05:18.411 --> 00:05:21.272
Just gonna uncheck that and apply.

100
00:05:21.272 --> 00:05:23.677
And you should see here a few more folders

101
00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:27.095
have appeared and one of them is this lxss

102
00:05:27.095 --> 00:05:31.151
and inside of there is home, remy is my user name,

103
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:32.697
foo and there we go.

104
00:05:32.697 --> 00:05:35.262
That's the file that I just made.

105
00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:36.510
There's obviously nothing in it

106
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.788
but you can see that's the file I've just made.

107
00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.705
If I, hi there, command + S I think it is,

108
00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:49.018 line:15% 
go back here cat this-file,

109
00:05:49.018 --> 00:05:53.018 line:15% 
yes you can see, cat,

110
00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:56.534
you can actually see the contents of the file just there,

111
00:05:56.534 --> 00:05:59.787
it's kind of connecting with my username.

112
00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:01.801
But you can see actually, this does work pretty well.

113
00:06:01.801 --> 00:06:04.897
So if you are a Windows user, you will be able to do

114
00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:08.419
everything that I cover in the Screencasts and more.

115
00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.030
So you'll be able to use tools like orc, node,

116
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.711
and all kinds of things.

117
00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:18.794
There's more grep, said, all the LS commands, ps,

118
00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:23.923
I instal htop using brew, sorry, apt-get earlier.

119
00:06:25.607 --> 00:06:28.480
So we will see that in a later Screencast as well.

120
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.926
It's all there, so Windows is as far as I'm concerned

121
00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:33.759
completely compatible.
