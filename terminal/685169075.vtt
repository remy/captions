1
00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:03.707
<v ->So it's possible you'll find yourself</v>

2
00:00:03.707 --> 00:00:06.124
in a situation where you'll need to edit a file

3
00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:09.325
and, but you don't have your normal kind of GUI,

4
00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:11.645
something like a Mac or Windows or whatever.

5
00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:15.161
I would typically go for something like Sublime.

6
00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.754
You might use another programme.

7
00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:18.500
But let's say that you've somehow connected

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.255
to another machine,

9
00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:22.424
or you don't have the other tools

10
00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:23.655
that you're used to,

11
00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:25.419
and you need to edit a file.

12
00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.915
Now, from the Command Line, there are a few options.

13
00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:31.783
And this doesn't guarantee any of them are installed.

14
00:00:31.783 --> 00:00:34.051
Most systems have them installed by default.

15
00:00:34.051 --> 00:00:35.277
Certainly your Mac will have a bunch of them

16
00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:36.596
installed by default,

17
00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:40.763
but there are three editors that I would consider.

18
00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:46.903
The first one is Vim, or Vi, as I tend to think of it.

19
00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:48.350
Vi is like an early version.

20
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.941
Vim is Vi Improved or something like that,

21
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.024
Vim Improved.

22
00:00:54.813 --> 00:00:57.480
It's not particularly intuitive,

23
00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:01.711
but it's the one that I'm most used to,

24
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.750
and I'm going to show you just a couple of commands.

25
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.998
Most common gripe with Vim,

26
00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:07.710
if you search the web,

27
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.088
is quitting Vim, actually being able to leave.

28
00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:13.720
It can be tricky if you don't know the command,

29
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.612
and you just get stuck inside of there.

30
00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:17.464
Another one is Emacs.

31
00:01:17.464 --> 00:01:19.797
There is, if you're familiar

32
00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.985
with the tabs-versus-spaces argument,

33
00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:28.143
Vim versus Emacs is a very old, long-running

34
00:01:28.143 --> 00:01:31.726
similar kind of war or clash of two groups.

35
00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.291
So Emacs is another editor.

36
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:39.702
I actually have never really used Emacs at all,

37
00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:41.349
and I had a quick go with this.

38
00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.516
Talk about stuck inside of it as well.

39
00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:47.040
And similar, has a lot of key combinations

40
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.730
that you need to know to be able to navigate.

41
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.214
But the third one is called Nano,

42
00:01:50.214 --> 00:01:51.931
which is actually a lot more user friendly

43
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.956
when it comes to being able to navigate.

44
00:01:53.956 --> 00:01:57.539
So I'm just going to show you Vim and Nano,

45
00:01:59.117 --> 00:02:00.937
and if you are forced to make a choice,

46
00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:03.837
I would recommend using Nano

47
00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:06.227
just to kind of jump in and out.

48
00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:08.308
But if you wanted to learn more about Vim,

49
00:02:08.308 --> 00:02:09.613
there is loads of information on the web,

50
00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:12.901
and I'll include a few links as well.

51
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:16.707
Vim alone could take up three hours' worth of learning.

52
00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:19.610
Vi and Vim are the same command. If you don't have Vi or Vim

53
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.026
on your Mac, or your Linux machine, or your Windows machine,

54
00:02:24.026 --> 00:02:25.666
you can instal them.

55
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.898
And we're going to edit a file.

56
00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:29.634
So I've got some of these default files

57
00:02:29.634 --> 00:02:31.502
from previous videos.

58
00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:33.770
I have some syntax highlighting already built in.

59
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.318
You may not have highlighting built in.

60
00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:37.457
You may see a white version of this,

61
00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:39.457
rather, just white text.

62
00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.870
I'm using the cursor keys to move my cursor around.

63
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.038
Because there's only one line,

64
00:02:46.038 --> 00:02:47.686
I can't go up and down.

65
00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.148
If I try and type,

66
00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:50.951
nothing really happens because at the moment,

67
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:53.036
I'm in Command Mode.

68
00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:55.453
If I want to change any text,

69
00:02:57.853 --> 00:02:59.129
I need to insert some text,

70
00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.874
I need to go into Text Mode.

71
00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:02.017
And the way that I would typically do that

72
00:03:02.017 --> 00:03:04.384
is press the I key.

73
00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:05.752
And now I'm able to edit.

74
00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:06.865
So I can make some changes.

75
00:03:06.865 --> 00:03:08.806
You can see that Enter does something.

76
00:03:08.806 --> 00:03:10.662
I'm gonna put in a comment.

77
00:03:10.662 --> 00:03:12.162
This is a comment.

78
00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:18.891
From here, quitting is really the hard part

79
00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:21.024
because I'm not in Edit Mode.

80
00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:24.689
I need to go back to Command Mode to quit Vim.

81
00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.844
So I'm gonna hit Escape.

82
00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:30.505
Escape is how you always go back to Command Mode.

83
00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:35.203
You can see the cursor's actually on top of the character

84
00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:37.092
I think, when I go in to insert.

85
00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.876
Oh no, it's the same with my keyboard.

86
00:03:39.876 --> 00:03:40.936
So I'm back in Command Mode.

87
00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:42.912
I've pressed Escape.

88
00:03:42.912 --> 00:03:44.294
And there's two things that you might want to do.

89
00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:45.494
One is saving, and one is quitting.

90
00:03:45.494 --> 00:03:47.397
If I try and quit now,

91
00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:51.230
there's a warning saying there's some changes.

92
00:03:52.372 --> 00:03:54.853
If I want to Force Quit, I can do--

93
00:03:54.853 --> 00:03:58.156
Sorry, see, to run commands, you need a colon,

94
00:03:58.156 --> 00:04:03.064
and down there in the corner, I can do Q + !,

95
00:04:03.064 --> 00:04:04.413
and that will do a Force Quit.

96
00:04:04.413 --> 00:04:07.286
It would discard my changes.

97
00:04:07.286 --> 00:04:10.295
Something I'm very used to doing is

98
00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:14.462
: + W + Q. W means writes the file, and Q means

99
00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.529
quit the programme at the same time.

100
00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.368
So W will write that file, and make that change.

101
00:04:21.368 --> 00:04:23.868
And if I make another change--

102
00:04:26.715 --> 00:04:27.714
this is another change--

103
00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:31.881
I can do : + W + Q and it will exit and write that file.

104
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.247
So if I cat that file out,

105
00:04:35.247 --> 00:04:37.792
you can see there's the change.

106
00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:38.875
So that's Vi.

107
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.558
Opening it, inserting, so I to insert the cursor

108
00:04:45.558 --> 00:04:47.819
to start typing, Escape to quit, to go back

109
00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.487
to the Command Line,

110
00:04:49.487 --> 00:04:52.062
and : + W + Q is pretty much the way

111
00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:54.229
you always want to go out.

112
00:04:55.135 --> 00:04:57.527
Nano, a lot friendlier.

113
00:04:57.527 --> 00:04:58.360
So Nano,

114
00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:02.733
you can see, first of all,

115
00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:04.472
right at the bottom are the commands.

116
00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:07.239
And you start off in Insert Mode,

117
00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.831
so I can delete text,

118
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:11.104
the way that you'd probably expect

119
00:05:11.104 --> 00:05:15.182
to be able to delete in Sublime or something like that.

120
00:05:15.182 --> 00:05:17.630
I've made some changes here.

121
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.041
The caret down at the bottom

122
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.046
where it says ^X,

123
00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:22.670
that is the Control Key.

124
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.181
So if I press Control + X to exit,

125
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.598
notice there is no save here.

126
00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:31.167
I'm sure there are more commands

127
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:32.913
tucked away, but what we're really looking to do

128
00:05:32.913 --> 00:05:34.746
is just save and exit.

129
00:05:35.923 --> 00:05:39.476
Control + X, and then it asks me do I want to go ahead

130
00:05:39.476 --> 00:05:41.940
and save my changes,

131
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.556
so I can cancel, yes or no.

132
00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:47.025
It's much more GUI-like.

133
00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:49.515
So yes, I wanna make the changes,

134
00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.860
asks me what file name.

135
00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.772
I'm just gonna write existing file, press Enter.

136
00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:54.689
And I've quit.

137
00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:55.522
And if we cat that out,

138
00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:58.043
we can see the change has been made.

139
00:05:58.043 --> 00:05:59.419
If you do get into this pickle

140
00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:02.086
where you have to use an editor,

141
00:06:03.033 --> 00:06:05.224
Nano is probably the best route to go.

142
00:06:05.224 --> 00:06:07.555
You may need to instal Nano,

143
00:06:07.555 --> 00:06:09.305
so brew instal nano,

144
00:06:10.777 --> 00:06:12.782
or if you're on a Unix machine,

145
00:06:12.782 --> 00:06:16.463
you might need to do apt-get instal nano.

146
00:06:16.463 --> 00:06:18.296
Same goes for Windows.

147
00:06:20.288 --> 00:06:23.275
Then you'll have Nano if you don't have it already.

148
00:06:23.275 --> 00:06:26.570
We now know how to quit some programmes.

149
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.169
And Emacs is there if you want to have a play.

150
00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.208
I'm not a fan, mostly because I don't even know

151
00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:34.708
how to quit Emacs.

152
00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.944
So I'll be here trying to quit Emacs,

153
00:06:39.944 --> 00:06:41.241
whilst you can move on to the next video.
