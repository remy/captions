00:00:01.603 --> 00:00:05.094
<v ->So next we're going to look at three commands.</v>

2
00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:07.648
Head, Tail, and Less.

3
00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:10.981
So Head will look at the head of a file,

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.295
so the top few lines and you can determine

5
00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:18.459
how many lines you want as well in the arguments.

6
00:00:18.459 --> 00:00:22.239
Tail will look at the last few lines

7
00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.630
and again it's like Head, you can specify

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.666
the number of lines you're looking for

9
00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.001
and you can pipe things together

10
00:00:28.001 --> 00:00:31.418
so you can grep before you pipe into Tail

11
00:00:34.972 --> 00:00:37.555
so you only tail specific lines

12
00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:40.192
that match what you're looking for.

13
00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:44.359
And Less which allows us to open up a stream or a file

14
00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:50.166
and basically go back and forth

15
00:00:52.277 --> 00:00:54.587
and search and so on.

16
00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:57.666
So far in the examples I've been showing you

17
00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:00.327
what I've been doing is looking at individual files

18
00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:03.897
where when we print to the screen,

19
00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.179
there is a definite start and a definite end.

20
00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:07.679
So it always ends.

21
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:11.722
When we are catting out the blog post,

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.400
it finished so it had a determined length.

23
00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:21.919
But all these commands also support things called Streams.

24
00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:28.478
So Streams are for this particular purpose

25
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.561
basically are never-ending files.

26
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.054
So when you...

27
00:01:38.054 --> 00:01:41.746
Basically at the moment I've got a live search going

28
00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:46.125
off to Twitter for one of the trending phrases,

29
00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:47.671
I think it's freezing.

30
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.499
It's quite cold outside at the moment

31
00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.160
and I have that writing to a log file called freezing.

32
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.209
Okay, so that's in the background.

33
00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.126
It's a command called t, it's tricky to Google.

34
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:05.077
But the point is that this log file is getting

35
00:02:05.077 --> 00:02:06.034
larger and larger.

36
00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:09.003
So if we just look at freezing.log,

37
00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:11.051
if we just keep looking at it,

38
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:14.876
over time, no of course no one's tweeting,

39
00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:17.341
someone tweeted finally.

40
00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:18.174
And a few more.

41
00:02:18.174 --> 00:02:20.985
So the point is that this file is continuously getting

42
00:02:20.985 --> 00:02:22.751
bigger and bigger.

43
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:24.137
Now we can tail that file.

44
00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:28.553
So if we do tail freezing, we get the end of the file

45
00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:32.540
and it immediately ends and comes back to our prompt,

46
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.275
but we can also continuously tail.

47
00:02:35.275 --> 00:02:37.608
So tail dash f means follow.

48
00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.881
So it follows the end of the file.

49
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:43.019
If I hit enter now, you can see that I don't get

50
00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.610
my prompt back.

51
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.616
And the screen will keep on kind of updating

52
00:02:47.616 --> 00:02:51.099
with each new line that comes into the file.

53
00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.356
Now this is really handy for tailing log files.

54
00:02:55.356 --> 00:02:57.245
So if you have some file that's getting bigger

55
00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.741
and bigger like a log, like a web log for instance,

56
00:03:00.741 --> 00:03:04.074
or some URL endpoint, we can tail dash f

57
00:03:06.616 --> 00:03:09.437
and it will follow this stream.

58
00:03:09.437 --> 00:03:11.705
From there we can do more things

59
00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:13.122
like we can grep.

60
00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:18.090
So what kinds of words are kind of coming up?

61
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.850
Maybe we just want the at symbols.

62
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.457
I think maybe we just want the Twitter handles.

63
00:03:22.457 --> 00:03:25.624
So what we'll do is we'll grep for at.

64
00:03:30.682 --> 00:03:31.952
I have a feeling there's a bunch of spaces

65
00:03:31.952 --> 00:03:33.534
in front of this so we're not quite getting

66
00:03:33.534 --> 00:03:34.552
what we're looking for.

67
00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:38.208
So I'm going to stick those spaces in there.

68
00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:39.375
Here is a tab.

69
00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:44.721
Now I try and grep first without the follow,

70
00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:47.471
see if I actually match anything.

71
00:04:06.388 --> 00:04:09.401
Okay, so I've had to use egrep

72
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:10.972
which I mentioned before is a slightly

73
00:04:10.972 --> 00:04:13.461
more advanced version of the grep.

74
00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:15.055
It allows me to do irregular expressions.

75
00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.252
Just trust for the moment that what this means is

76
00:04:17.252 --> 00:04:19.288
it start at the beginning of the line,

77
00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:21.895
there are some spaces, one or more,

78
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:23.274
and then there's an at symbol.

79
00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:25.941
So we'll get the last few tweets

80
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:30.991
but if we do tail dash f, we now just get

81
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:32.279
the Twitter handles.

82
00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.947
And I mentioned that we can have more

83
00:04:33.947 --> 00:04:34.830
than one line.

84
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.872
If I go back to tail, I can do tail dash 100

85
00:04:37.872 --> 00:04:40.142
or a thousand and it will give me

86
00:04:40.142 --> 00:04:43.390
the last thousand lines and it will stop following.

87
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.404
So you can see all of the people

88
00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:48.373
that have tweeted with a hashtag freezing

89
00:04:48.373 --> 00:04:50.163
and if I push enter a few times

90
00:04:50.163 --> 00:04:53.598
when a tweet comes in, we'll see that Twitter handle.

91
00:04:53.598 --> 00:04:56.049
And then we could do more things with that if we wanted to.

92
00:04:56.049 --> 00:04:57.340
We could do more manipulation,

93
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.259
but tail dash f is really useful

94
00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.663
for kind of watching files and following files

95
00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:08.380
in real time and then we can pipe that output,

96
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.880
that string to something else.

97
00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:12.979
So I mentioned Head.

98
00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.050
Head is very similar.

99
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.217
We can do head dash 10 and we can look at the first 10,

100
00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:21.698
follow.log.

101
00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:24.987
No, freezing.log.

102
00:05:24.987 --> 00:05:27.820
We can look at the first 10 lines.

103
00:05:29.908 --> 00:05:33.551
Okay, we can, what we can do is we can grep

104
00:05:33.551 --> 00:05:36.210
or use that egrep that we had a moment ago.

105
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.365
Scroll up.

106
00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:39.898
What we'll do is use the egrep on the freezing.log.

107
00:05:39.898 --> 00:05:42.407
We'll look at the first 10 people

108
00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:43.805
who tweeted about it.

109
00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:45.039
That's not particularly the first 10 people

110
00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.039
who tweeted at the time.

111
00:05:47.878 --> 00:05:50.086
It's the first 10 that I captured.

112
00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:51.003
So dash 10.

113
00:05:52.205 --> 00:05:54.662
Oops, I didn't give it a file to follow.

114
00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:57.103
Freezing and there we go.

115
00:05:57.103 --> 00:05:59.151
So there's the first 10 people.

116
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:01.234
I think we can do dash n.

117
00:06:02.123 --> 00:06:03.040
Not dash n.

118
00:06:08.105 --> 00:06:09.565
If we get the line number,

119
00:06:09.565 --> 00:06:10.398
man head.

120
00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:16.566
No, I don't think we can get the line number.

121
00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:23.566
So yeah we can see the Twitter handles

122
00:06:26.008 --> 00:06:29.175
and we can do some other bits I think.

123
00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:32.590
What else do we have on Head?

124
00:06:35.717 --> 00:06:39.467
So dash n is the same as what we've got here.

125
00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:43.654
I'm pretty sure we can do an offset as well.

126
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:47.285
So I think we can do like offset one.

127
00:06:47.285 --> 00:06:50.535
Alright so we can start from the first,

128
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.994
like skip the first line basically.

129
00:06:53.994 --> 00:06:57.587
So I think, just coming back actually,

130
00:06:57.587 --> 00:07:00.254
you can say skip the first line.

131
00:07:01.158 --> 00:07:04.491
You can say the first of the 10 I think,

132
00:07:06.752 --> 00:07:08.886
but if only works with the file.

133
00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.634
With a stream, there is no end

134
00:07:11.634 --> 00:07:14.551
so it doesn't really know where to,

135
00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:17.534
where to split the data basically.

136
00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:19.853
But if we want to skip the first line,

137
00:07:19.853 --> 00:07:24.673
we could do the first 11 lines and then tail dash 10.

138
00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:26.832
Kind of funky but it does work.

139
00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:27.838
So what we're doing is we're getting

140
00:07:27.838 --> 00:07:29.751
the first 11 lines and then just getting

141
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:31.714
the last 10 of those first 11 lines

142
00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:34.266
by putting the two together.

143
00:07:34.266 --> 00:07:36.916
And the last one I want to show you is Less.

144
00:07:36.916 --> 00:07:40.333
So there are two commands, More and Less.

145
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.699
And I think the expression is something like

146
00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:44.782
less is more.

147
00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.250
Opposite of more.

148
00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:53.758
They almost do the same thing but Less is better

149
00:07:53.758 --> 00:07:55.892
than More because it has more functionality,

150
00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:58.124
it's easier to use.

151
00:07:58.124 --> 00:07:59.621
So if you're ever kind of confused

152
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:03.788
about which one you want, you want Less 'cause less is more.

153
00:08:05.043 --> 00:08:06.599
Anyway.

154
00:08:06.599 --> 00:08:08.772
So we have this freezing file.

155
00:08:08.772 --> 00:08:12.268
We could cat the freezing file out.

156
00:08:12.268 --> 00:08:14.157
But if we're searching for something specific

157
00:08:14.157 --> 00:08:16.074
like maybe Christmas...

158
00:08:18.154 --> 00:08:20.632
We could use grep but we can also use Less.

159
00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:24.465
So if you use less freezing, it goes into this

160
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.393
kind of cursor view.

161
00:08:27.393 --> 00:08:30.153
So I can hit space and it will let me

162
00:08:30.153 --> 00:08:32.103
kind of page down.

163
00:08:32.103 --> 00:08:36.053
And if I do shift space, it will go, sorry,

164
00:08:36.053 --> 00:08:36.886
b and f.

165
00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:41.475
B is backwards and f is forwards.

166
00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.682
And I can also search.

167
00:08:45.682 --> 00:08:48.896
If I use the slash key, you can see down here

168
00:08:48.896 --> 00:08:51.096
in the corner, it's changed to a slash

169
00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:53.679
and I can search for Christmas.

170
00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.885
I think I can do, oops.

171
00:08:58.538 --> 00:08:59.871
So I just hit h.

172
00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:03.074
Gosh, quit.

173
00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.070
So h gives me the help.

174
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.987
And q gets out of Less.

175
00:09:10.301 --> 00:09:13.589
And let's just look for Christmas.

176
00:09:13.589 --> 00:09:17.110
There we have Christmas up in the corner there.

177
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.238
We see it matches a couple of times.

178
00:09:20.238 --> 00:09:22.460
It's useful for kind of opening up,

179
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.752
to take a stream and just kind of pause it

180
00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:25.942
and look at it.

181
00:09:25.942 --> 00:09:29.694
So we could do tail minus f freezing.

182
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:32.897
And let's get the first 1,000 lines,

183
00:09:32.897 --> 00:09:35.064
but let's pipe it to Less.

184
00:09:37.276 --> 00:09:40.400
And that'll keep getting longer and longer and longer,

185
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.890
but I can page through in my own pace basically.

186
00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.684
So I'm paging all the way down to the end.

187
00:09:47.684 --> 00:09:49.085
I keep hitting space.

188
00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:50.005
I'll get to the end.

189
00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:53.096
It should print new lines as they come in,

190
00:09:53.096 --> 00:09:57.013
but I can also go back, look for bits and bobs.

191
00:09:57.917 --> 00:10:00.420
Whoops, there you go.

192
00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:05.044
So yeah, that was Head or Tail probably the most useful

193
00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:06.798
for kind of looking at the end of things,

194
00:10:06.798 --> 00:10:09.301
certainly tail dash f.

195
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:12.427
Head being the opposite of Tail rather.

196
00:10:12.427 --> 00:10:16.177
And Less for kind of going into text streams,

197
00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:19.761
it can be used with files as well

198
00:10:19.761 --> 00:10:22.561
for basic searching and paging back and forth.

199
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:23.394
See ya.
