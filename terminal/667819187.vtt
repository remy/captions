1
00:00:02.186 --> 00:00:04.095
<v ->Okay, so now we've encountered a file</v>

2
00:00:04.095 --> 00:00:08.032
that belongs to another user that we want to delete.

3
00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:10.949
So we have this directory rems-dir,

4
00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:13.839
and if we look at this column here,

5
00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:15.740
we'll look at permissions in next video,

6
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.726
the one thing you can see that's different

7
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:20.077
is the owner is remy, not rem,

8
00:00:20.077 --> 00:00:24.778
so there's this other person with the same name, sort of,

9
00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:27.478
that has this rems-dir.

10
00:00:27.478 --> 00:00:30.796
But we can go into it, and we can see

11
00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:33.758
there's a secret file in there, okay.

12
00:00:33.758 --> 00:00:36.634
Let's cat that secret out.

13
00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:38.535
Hmm, permission denied.

14
00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:40.184
So that means I don't have permission

15
00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:41.318
to actually look at it.

16
00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:42.872
Well, I don't want it in my directory,

17
00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:45.372
so I'm going to get rid of it.

18
00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:48.392
Yes.

19
00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:49.444
Ah, permission denied as well.

20
00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:52.815
Well, let's try the forced delete.

21
00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:55.156
Also permission denied.

22
00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:57.592
So in this case, I don't have permission to

23
00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:02.358
get rid of the file at all, and it means I'm stuck with it.

24
00:01:02.358 --> 00:01:04.164
Although this is contrived, I put the file there

25
00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:07.230
in the first place, there might be a legitimate reason

26
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.708
why you don't have permission to write a file,

27
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.029
to delete a file.

28
00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:15.944
But sometimes you might be trying to clear something up,

29
00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:18.861
or fix some problem, and in this case

30
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:21.059
we need to get rid of this secret,

31
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:24.293
and so the way to do that is to use something called sudo.

32
00:01:24.293 --> 00:01:26.962
And sudo is literally spelled S-U-D-O,

33
00:01:26.962 --> 00:01:28.964
so superuser do.

34
00:01:28.964 --> 00:01:32.567
It's kind of like Simon Says, and then you give a command.

35
00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:36.017
So sudo rm, or let's cat out the secret.

36
00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:39.612
Sudo cat secret, so it's like saying

37
00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:44.053
I want to make this superuser, which is root,

38
00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:45.881
which is the owner of all the machinery,

39
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:49.806
the root user can do anything to this machine,

40
00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:51.473
sudo cat the secret.

41
00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:54.690
At that point it's going to ask me for my password,

42
00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.344
not the superuser's password, but my password.

43
00:01:58.344 --> 00:02:00.820
And what it's doing here is it tends to record

44
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.510
that I try to do a thing.

45
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.114
By default, if you have a Mac out of box

46
00:02:06.114 --> 00:02:08.802
there'll be certain things you can sudo to do,

47
00:02:08.802 --> 00:02:11.216
and there'll be some things you can't do.

48
00:02:11.216 --> 00:02:13.212
And we'll come on to how you do that in a moment,

49
00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:15.575
but I'm just going to put in my password,

50
00:02:15.575 --> 00:02:18.168
and it cats out the file, so it means that

51
00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:22.620
the superuser, that root user that has all the power,

52
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.061
is able to cat that file out.

53
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:28.629
So try that again ourselves, permission denied,

54
00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.296
but we're using the superuser, we're able to

55
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:35.820
cat the file out, which also means we can delete

56
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.541
the file using the same command,

57
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.708
so this doesn't work, but,

58
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.083
sudo rm secret will work.

59
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.611
Okay, and it didn't ask me the password that time

60
00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:51.949
because I had recently used sudo,

61
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:53.211
and when you've recently used it,

62
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:55.091
it just kind of keeps the fact that

63
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:56.811
you're authenticated for a few minutes.

64
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:58.589
I can't remember exactly how long it is,

65
00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.960
but if I open up another terminal window,

66
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.109
it'll ask me the password again.

67
00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.478
So that's now gone.

68
00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:07.100
I've removed the secret that I didn't have permission

69
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.229
to remove before, and if we go back into this directory,

70
00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:15.369
let's see if we can remove rm -rf rems-dir,

71
00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.629
and we're able to get rid of it completely,

72
00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.268
because that file that we didn't have permission to

73
00:03:21.268 --> 00:03:25.351
read or write has been removed, and in this case,

74
00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:30.951
in the rems-dir, I was part of the same group.

75
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:33.669
Again, we'll look at permission in a moment,

76
00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.530
I just want to stay on sudo for a moment.

77
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.780
So sudo, you can do a number of things.

78
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.317
You can go to the very top-most superuser, known as root.

79
00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:52.050
Typically we just sudo and then some command.

80
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.469
But you can also sudo to other users,

81
00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.930
so you can become other users, and the way

82
00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.800
that you might do that is sudo and the su,

83
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.717
which is switch user, I'm thinking.

84
00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.609
Yeah, switch user.

85
00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.899
And then I can give the user name of the other user

86
00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:14.029
and I'll be prompted, oop, I haven't been prompted

87
00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.989
because I already put my password in,

88
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.357
and now I've actually switched user.

89
00:04:19.357 --> 00:04:23.538
If I type in whoami, you can see I'm remy,

90
00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:26.455
whereas typically whoami shows rem.

91
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:31.720
So it means I've switched users at that point.

92
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.989
Now, on this Mac at the moment,

93
00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:37.949
there's no real great advantage to switching between users,

94
00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.669
but when you're working on a machine that's shared,

95
00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.836
maybe like a remote server, being able

96
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.789
to switch users is pretty handy,

97
00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.497
being able to kind of su to root,

98
00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.118
so you could do sudo dash root,

99
00:04:52.118 --> 00:04:54.699
I think if you don't give a, yeah,

100
00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.909
if you don't give a user name, the dash means

101
00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.109
kind of pull in and automatically go to the root directory.

102
00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:04.109
And you can see here, this was my user name before,

103
00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:05.539
this is my user name now.

104
00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.987
Whoami, I'm root on this machine.

105
00:05:08.987 --> 00:05:13.548
Now, like I said root has power to do everything.

106
00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:16.548
They can delete files from any user,

107
00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.579
they can change permissions, cause all kinds of chaos,

108
00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:22.970
and this is actually the reason why

109
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.360
we're not root by default, we don't have permission

110
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.931
to do all this stuff by default.

111
00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:29.531
Say for instance you try to delete like

112
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:33.131
a core system file from your Mac or your PC,

113
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:34.267
you want it to prompt you

114
00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:37.829
and maybe even stop you from doing that.

115
00:05:37.829 --> 00:05:41.336
Couple of decades ago, or in fact more than that,

116
00:05:41.336 --> 00:05:44.179
I had a PC and I deleted two of the core files

117
00:05:44.179 --> 00:05:46.080
that you used to boot the entire thing.

118
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.589
Never prompted me to do it, I was trying to

119
00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:50.549
clean up some space, and because it didn't have

120
00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:53.138
that permissioning system in place,

121
00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:54.689
I completely hosed the machine.

122
00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:56.779
I had to learn very quickly how to fix it all.

123
00:05:56.779 --> 00:06:00.946
So that is why by default I'm signed in as Rem or Remy,

124
00:06:01.848 --> 00:06:04.499
I'm always signed in as like a lower user,

125
00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:06.149
and you will be as well.

126
00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:08.979
If you're finding that you're signing in as root

127
00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.059
to a machine, you want to kind of look at

128
00:06:12.059 --> 00:06:14.528
why you're doing that and maybe consider

129
00:06:14.528 --> 00:06:17.349
creating a new user with less privileges.

130
00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.008
It also means that if your password

131
00:06:20.008 --> 00:06:23.408
is compromised somehow, they may not have the root password.

132
00:06:23.408 --> 00:06:26.499
There's a lot more insecurity that you can read about,

133
00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:30.280
but sudo's very powerful, but be wary of it,

134
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.200
be wary that it can do anything.

135
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.700
It can really make a big mess.

136
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.498
So, like I mentioned just earlier,

137
00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:41.480
you may not have permission to do everything

138
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.897
that root can do, and you may

139
00:06:44.829 --> 00:06:46.109
or may not want to change that,

140
00:06:46.109 --> 00:06:50.059
but there is a file in /etc/sudoers

141
00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:53.859
which controls how much sudo power you have.

142
00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:58.026
So we jump into that file, we get permission denied.

143
00:06:59.328 --> 00:07:03.219
If I do sudo and then vi /etc/sudoers,

144
00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:04.052
you don't have to use vi,

145
00:07:04.052 --> 00:07:06.728
you can use something less sublime,

146
00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:09.128
but I'm just showing you the file for the moment,

147
00:07:09.128 --> 00:07:11.068
you can see in here now I have permission

148
00:07:11.068 --> 00:07:13.928
to open the file because I used sudo,

149
00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:15.680
the root user will open it,

150
00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.909
and if we run down here, you can see

151
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.076
I've already added rem to have the ability to do everything.

152
00:07:24.938 --> 00:07:27.861
And all I did was copy this line,

153
00:07:27.861 --> 00:07:30.629
root ALL=(ALL) ALL,

154
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:32.821
and I just copy and pasted it in the line below,

155
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:35.968
putting in my user name and saving that at that point

156
00:07:35.968 --> 00:07:38.135
my user can do everything.

157
00:07:38.999 --> 00:07:40.669
So that's sudo.

158
00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:44.480
Use with care, but it's definitely worth knowing about

159
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.647
to get a kind of, just get outside the limits of your user.
