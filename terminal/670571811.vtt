00:00:02.144 --> 00:00:02.977
<v ->So what I'm going to show you</v>

2
00:00:02.977 --> 00:00:04.027
over the next series of videos

3
00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:06.309
is how to customise your terminal.

4
00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.019
And the customization isn't just for

5
00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.386
adding some nice colours.

6
00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.222
It's really to create an environment

7
00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:15.987
that you like to work in.

8
00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:18.888
There's nothing worse than having kind of a text

9
00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:19.902
that is enforced on you

10
00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:22.608
or a type of browser that you don't like using.

11
00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:25.301
You'd much rather use a tool that you enjoy spending time in

12
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:26.938
if you're going to use it.

13
00:00:26.938 --> 00:00:29.344
So customization's kind of a key part of that.

14
00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:32.646
So I'm logged into my personal user at the moment.

15
00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:36.112
If I just switch over to iTerm and open up a new window

16
00:00:36.112 --> 00:00:39.772
you'll see the kind of view that I see.

17
00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:41.939
So this image just loaded.

18
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.976
It is an upside down unicorn I believe.

19
00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:48.828
And this is what my normal terminal looks like,

20
00:00:48.828 --> 00:00:50.584
so every time I open a new terminal

21
00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.167
I get a different ASCII unicorn

22
00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:57.936
just to make things brighten up a little bit in my terminal.

23
00:00:57.936 --> 00:00:59.690
You'll also notice that the prompt is completely different

24
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.734
to what you've seen in the previous videos.

25
00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.093
You might be able to spot the colour

26
00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:05.538
is slightly different in the background.

27
00:01:05.538 --> 00:01:07.563
It's a little bit blue.

28
00:01:07.563 --> 00:01:08.690
My prompt is down here.

29
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.334
I have this indicator bar over here.

30
00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.162
So I just want to talk about some of the terminology

31
00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:15.414
and some of the customizations.

32
00:01:15.414 --> 00:01:17.714
And just to give you a feel for this as well,

33
00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:21.131
when I view my terminal I always have it full screen

34
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:22.601
so it looks like this.

35
00:01:22.601 --> 00:01:25.569
There's no bar at the top when I have anything else,

36
00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.454
and I can switch back and forth from it

37
00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.360
when I bring up Chrome for a second.

38
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.606
I can bring it to focus by doing command escape

39
00:01:33.606 --> 00:01:36.958
and hitting command escape again.

40
00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.625
So I run my terminal full screen

41
00:01:41.307 --> 00:01:43.724
and I also have some shortcuts that I'm really used to

42
00:01:43.724 --> 00:01:45.812
and I have the system configured

43
00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:47.846
the way that I like to use it.

44
00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:50.492 line:15% 
Now that doesn't mean you have to copy exactly what I have.

45
00:01:50.492 --> 00:01:53.148 line:15% 
I have a blog post that describes kind of some of my setup.

46
00:01:53.148 --> 00:01:55.669 line:15% 
I have some of the dotfiles, the configuration files

47
00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:57.636 line:15% 
in gifhub that somebody else can use,

48
00:01:57.636 --> 00:02:01.725 line:15% 
and a lot of other people put their dotfiles into gifhub

49
00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.431 line:15% 
for you to kind of use and take what you want.

50
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.318 line:15% 
But for instance one of the most used tools I have

51
00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:08.625 line:15% 
is this said, I just type a partial directory

52
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:10.241
and it jumps to that directory,

53
00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:12.661
and you can see here very different prompt.

54
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:16.020
It tells me about the gifhub state of this folder.

55
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.325
So I know that this colour when it's green

56
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.164
it means that there's some dirty files in there.

57
00:02:20.164 --> 00:02:22.408
There's something that's waiting to be changed.

58
00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:25.674
I have the directory name above my prompt,

59
00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:27.136
and over on the right here

60
00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:29.896
I've got a little bit of custom code that tells me,

61
00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:30.952
firstly I've got a dot that tells me

62
00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:32.413
whether or not I'm online

63
00:02:32.413 --> 00:02:34.093
because when I do some travelling I want to know if I have

64
00:02:34.093 --> 00:02:37.077
an active connexion and it just kind of refreshes

65
00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:38.288
every minute or so.

66
00:02:38.288 --> 00:02:40.153
So a green dot means I have a connexion

67
00:02:40.153 --> 00:02:41.802
and a red dot means I don't.

68
00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:42.884
And this is a ...

69
00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:44.600
My battery basically is sowed

70
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.448
because I spend quite a lot of time in my terminal,

71
00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:49.199
I want to be able to see it at a glance

72
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.118
how much battery I have

73
00:02:50.118 --> 00:02:54.251
so if I need a charge or anything like that.

74
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:57.499 line:15% 
And just a quick listing here gives you an idea

75
00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.671 line:15% 
of kind of what my prompt looks like.

76
00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:02.208 line:15% 
So I just want to go into a couple

77
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:05.182 line:15% 
of the bits of terminology around this.

78
00:03:05.182 --> 00:03:06.849
The first one is ...

79
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:11.521
This programme iTerm2 and maybe you're using Terminal still

80
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:13.488
or a different programme altogether.

81
00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:15.821
This is called the terminal,

82
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.064
the application that is running a shell,

83
00:03:21.064 --> 00:03:23.207
and at the moment I'm logged into a shell.

84
00:03:23.207 --> 00:03:25.176
So the shell really,

85
00:03:25.176 --> 00:03:26.221
the difference ...

86
00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:29.585
The way I look at it is that this grey bar here

87
00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:31.618
and kind of resizing is the terminal

88
00:03:31.618 --> 00:03:34.338
and how my mouse interacts with it is the terminal

89
00:03:34.338 --> 00:03:37.718
and everything inside, the text part, is the shell.

90
00:03:37.718 --> 00:03:42.376
So I can connect to a remote server, one of my web servers.

91
00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:45.515
I can connect to another machine in my home

92
00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:48.766
or when I'm at my work office I can connect to a machine

93
00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:51.649
and I'll go into that shell.

94
00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.226
And then a couple of important bits here,

95
00:03:54.226 --> 00:03:55.251
this is the prompt

96
00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:58.113
so where you type, we're already pretty familiar with it,

97
00:03:58.113 --> 00:04:00.327
but we can customise it quite a lot

98
00:04:00.327 --> 00:04:02.935
and I'm going to show you that in another video.

99
00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:06.774
But there's also aliases, so commands that kind of ...

100
00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:08.538
Short cuts to other commands that you can also write

101
00:04:08.538 --> 00:04:10.406
functions that do things.

102
00:04:10.406 --> 00:04:12.614
So one example, I have GS

103
00:04:12.614 --> 00:04:16.261
which is something that I've kind of got as muscle memory.

104
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:18.823
GS to me means get status.

105
00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:22.323
So I run GS and it shows me the get status

106
00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:26.298
for this directory and tells me what's waiting to be changed

107
00:04:26.298 --> 00:04:27.202
and so on.

108
00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:29.537
And I have GP which will do a get push

109
00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:30.458
and commit everything.

110
00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:33.267
I have a few others that will do little things

111
00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:34.348
here and there.

112
00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:37.832
There are more complicated scripts like I can type gist

113
00:04:37.832 --> 00:04:41.999
and it will, if I copy some text and then type gist,

114
00:04:42.974 --> 00:04:45.500
it will take that text, copy it,

115
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.097
and create a new gist for me,

116
00:04:47.097 --> 00:04:49.939
which you can see loading up now and you can see it there.

117
00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:52.676
I can go ahead and share that with someone else.

118
00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:55.515
So that's a function but still a command

119
00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:58.215
that I ran inside of my terminal

120
00:04:58.215 --> 00:05:01.542
and inside my shell and it gave me something back.

121
00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:05.505
So I wrote a little bit of shove scripting code to do that.

122
00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:08.576
Then on top of my terminal I have my preferences.

123
00:05:08.576 --> 00:05:12.290
So if I go to preferences over here

124
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.457
and I've got a few things that I've customised to my liking.

125
00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:20.087
The first one that I'd like to show you

126
00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.837
is I've turned off the animations

127
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:25.826
when you go to full screen and away,

128
00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:28.491
something that I prefer.

129
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:29.866
It's ... where is it ...

130
00:05:29.866 --> 00:05:32.411
Use native full screen windows.

131
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:34.212
I've unchecked that so I can go full screen

132
00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:37.555
without waiting for it to animate basically.

133
00:05:37.555 --> 00:05:39.652
I'm also backing up my entire preferences,

134
00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:40.657
which is down here.

135
00:05:40.657 --> 00:05:43.708
You've got a direction name and it just saves it,

136
00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:46.208
and I have a few other tweaks.

137
00:05:48.962 --> 00:05:51.006
So I've got a bunch of profiles here,

138
00:05:51.006 --> 00:05:51.957
which I don't really use.

139
00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:54.655
I actually just reconfigure the default one

140
00:05:54.655 --> 00:05:55.738
all the time.

141
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.183
I don't have anything special here,

142
00:05:58.183 --> 00:06:00.387
but if I open a new terminal for instance,

143
00:06:00.387 --> 00:06:04.088
I could have it show a different name,

144
00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:06.242
run a command automatically.

145
00:06:06.242 --> 00:06:08.715
I could stick some text in the prompt automatically.

146
00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:11.790
I could define what directory it starts up in.

147
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.663
Like maybe I always go to my site's directory

148
00:06:14.663 --> 00:06:18.758
so I could change that using this preference over here,

149
00:06:18.758 --> 00:06:20.257
leave that in home,

150
00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:22.967
and I've also got some colours that I've tweaked.

151
00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:26.955
I've just selected the solarized light

152
00:06:26.955 --> 00:06:29.494
or dark, which one is the one I'm using.

153
00:06:29.494 --> 00:06:32.168
I think this one might be my default actually,

154
00:06:32.168 --> 00:06:34.607
the one with the star.

155
00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:36.870
It was the solarized dark.

156
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.676
I made a couple of customizations

157
00:06:38.676 --> 00:06:40.382
and one of them was my cursor,

158
00:06:40.382 --> 00:06:43.780
which is this colour here so you can see

159
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.350
it's kind of this bright pink,

160
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:47.690
which just kind of draws my eye in a bit more

161
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.375
and things like text I've selected a bigger font

162
00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:55.731
so you can select the font size from here

163
00:06:55.731 --> 00:06:58.648
and I'm using Menlo with Powerline,

164
00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:03.175
and I'll include a link as to how to get Powerline.

165
00:07:03.175 --> 00:07:06.381
What Powerline gives you is just a few more glifs,

166
00:07:06.381 --> 00:07:08.136
like this thing.

167
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:11.176
You don't need it at all if you don't want to,

168
00:07:11.176 --> 00:07:12.555
but it gives me just a few more characters

169
00:07:12.555 --> 00:07:15.537
which make my terminal look a little bit nicer.

170
00:07:15.537 --> 00:07:17.965
And then beyond that I really don't have very much,

171
00:07:17.965 --> 00:07:19.955
but you can do things like opacity,

172
00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:22.274
so you can make your window semi-transparent

173
00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:23.897
so you can see things underneath it,

174
00:07:23.897 --> 00:07:27.134
which some people like, not myself so much.

175
00:07:27.134 --> 00:07:30.132
You can blur what's underneath and so on.

176
00:07:30.132 --> 00:07:30.965
Where is that?

177
00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:31.965
There we go.

178
00:07:33.104 --> 00:07:34.959
And then the keyboard shortcuts.

179
00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:36.001
So I think I mentioned

180
00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:38.860
right at the beginning of this whole series,

181
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.561
being able to split screens is something I use all the time

182
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:47.248
and I use these split screens and also keyboard shortcuts

183
00:07:47.248 --> 00:07:49.589
to navigate between the split screens.

184
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:52.276
If I bring this to full screen and then do command D

185
00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:53.210
I get another window,

186
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.581
but I can do command shift left and right

187
00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:57.974
and I can switch back and forth between the windows

188
00:07:57.974 --> 00:08:00.315
and if I do command shift D I get one above

189
00:08:00.315 --> 00:08:02.882
so I can use the cursor arrows to move around.

190
00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:05.035
I find that particularly helpful for me.

191
00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:07.027
You might have a set of keyboard preferences

192
00:08:07.027 --> 00:08:08.360
that you prefer.

193
00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:11.589
And then finally the hotkey.

194
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:13.118
This is the one I use,

195
00:08:13.118 --> 00:08:17.037
show/hide terminal as a system-wide hotkey.

196
00:08:17.037 --> 00:08:19.504
I use it, again you don't have to use this kind of thing

197
00:08:19.504 --> 00:08:21.512
but I use command escape.

198
00:08:21.512 --> 00:08:23.648
It's a keyboard combination I've had for years

199
00:08:23.648 --> 00:08:27.294
and it's just kind of burnt into my memory

200
00:08:27.294 --> 00:08:29.746
and that lets me kind of jump directly to the window

201
00:08:29.746 --> 00:08:30.579
no matter where I am

202
00:08:30.579 --> 00:08:33.919
so I can be browsing the internet, doing a thing,

203
00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.120
and I can just do command escape

204
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:38.227
and the whole of my terminal comes to the forefront

205
00:08:38.227 --> 00:08:40.830
and I carry on with what I'm doing.

206
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:43.042
So that's what my prompt looks like at the moment,

207
00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:46.636
my terminal, my shell, the whole thing.

208
00:08:46.636 --> 00:08:48.461
What we're going to look at next is a few tools.

209
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:50.590
The first thing that we're going to look at is called Fish,

210
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.429
which is a tool that you can just drop in

211
00:08:53.429 --> 00:08:55.027
and it gives you a lot of this customization

212
00:08:55.027 --> 00:08:55.994
straight out of the box

213
00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:58.890
and really the idea is that you don't have to customise it

214
00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.897
very much.

215
00:08:59.897 --> 00:09:01.165
You can just kind of select the thing

216
00:09:01.165 --> 00:09:02.467
that suits you the best

217
00:09:02.467 --> 00:09:04.936
and it will just make the experience better for you,

218
00:09:04.936 --> 00:09:06.686
and a lot of people use this.

219
00:09:06.686 --> 00:09:08.384
But then beyond that we're going to look at

220
00:09:08.384 --> 00:09:10.646
installing our own shell

221
00:09:10.646 --> 00:09:13.846
and making adjustments to kind of customise things.

222
00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:16.473
I'll show you how to make aliases and so on.

223
00:09:16.473 --> 00:09:18.489
So I'll see you in the next videos.
