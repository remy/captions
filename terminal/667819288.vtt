00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.502
<v ->So we've just seen how sudo can cause some chaos</v>

2
00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:06.397
but also give you extra privileges,

3
00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.028
and speaking of privileges

4
00:00:09.028 --> 00:00:12.804
the files have different permission existence

5
00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.960
and different privileges

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.229
that allow you to do different things to them.

7
00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:19.088
So there's three types of privilege,

8
00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:22.248
one is read, one is write, and one is execute.

9
00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:25.008
Now we looked at executing programmes

10
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.258
in a previous video series.

11
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:31.181
Read is being able to read the content,

12
00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:34.749
and write is to be able change the contents

13
00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.416
but also delete the file itself.

14
00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.589
Now going back to rems-dir,

15
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.423
remember I am remy,

16
00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.187
sorry, this user is called rem,

17
00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:48.726
which we see there in the prompt,

18
00:00:48.726 --> 00:00:50.827
and this other user called remy

19
00:00:50.827 --> 00:00:52.425
has created this secret file,

20
00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:55.167
and when I try and cat the secret

21
00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:56.488
I don't have permission.

22
00:00:56.488 --> 00:01:00.194
Now there's a few reasons for that.

23
00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.234
The first one is this.

24
00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:04.888
This tells us what the permissions are.

25
00:01:04.888 --> 00:01:09.055
In fact, actually if we go back into the directory

26
00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:11.579
we can see there's quite a bit

27
00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.754
of information in this listing,

28
00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:18.836
and on the left column when I include the -l

29
00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:22.253
it gives me the permissions and the type.

30
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.640
So I'm interested in this column here.

31
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.479
A directory has a d at the beginning,

32
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.020
so that's a clue that's a directory.

33
00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.687
When I do ltr, oops,

34
00:01:35.832 --> 00:01:38.832
I also in my personal terminal setup

35
00:01:41.076 --> 00:01:42.816
if I recall correctly actually has slashes

36
00:01:42.816 --> 00:01:44.376
on the end of each one of the directories,

37
00:01:44.376 --> 00:01:46.466
so there's an extra clue

38
00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:47.437
that I'm looking at a directory,

39
00:01:47.437 --> 00:01:50.764
but here the first character is used to tell us

40
00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:52.786
whether it's a directory or whether it's a file.

41
00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:55.992
So all of these are directories except for this last one

42
00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:58.654
because we see there's no d.

43
00:01:58.654 --> 00:02:03.124
The first three columns are the user permissions,

44
00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.373
and the user permissions are me,

45
00:02:04.373 --> 00:02:05.774
the person using this machine,

46
00:02:05.774 --> 00:02:08.071
I'm sorry, the the owner of the file,

47
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:10.494
not the person using the machine, the owner of the file.

48
00:02:10.494 --> 00:02:12.217
The owner of the file is rem.

49
00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:15.652
So I own the Pictures directory, Desktop, and so on.

50
00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.879
So I have read, write, and execute,

51
00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.287
and execute on a directory

52
00:02:20.287 --> 00:02:23.089
I think it doesn't tend to mean a lot,

53
00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.340
but it means if there's an executable file in there

54
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.400
I can execute it.

55
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.228
That might not be completely correct.

56
00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:34.177
But if we look in the bin directory

57
00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:37.226
we have that hello file from Chapter 2.

58
00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:40.198
We can see read, write, execute.

59
00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:43.295
So that means I can execute that hello programme.

60
00:02:43.295 --> 00:02:48.201
So if we just try and run that just as a reminder, it runs.

61
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.701
It just echos out Hello world.

62
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.103
So the next group,

63
00:02:54.103 --> 00:02:58.522
this after the first three, these three here,

64
00:02:58.522 --> 00:03:02.682
and this freezing.log that belongs to the rem user

65
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:06.402
is marked as read and then nothing and nothing,

66
00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:09.888
so that means it's only readable by people in my group.

67
00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:13.874
So it goes user, the next three is group,

68
00:03:13.874 --> 00:03:16.378
and the last three is other, people outside of my group.

69
00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:18.988
And on a Mac they have this group called staff

70
00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:21.416
which normal users are part of.

71
00:03:21.416 --> 00:03:23.652
I think root user is part of staff,

72
00:03:23.652 --> 00:03:26.292
and any user on this machine would be part of staff.

73
00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:29.262
And then depending on the complexity

74
00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:30.364
of the system you're working on

75
00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:32.964
there might be other groups and so on,

76
00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:37.369
but in this case any other user on this machine

77
00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:39.742
will be in the group staff,

78
00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:43.062
and they will be able to read this file.

79
00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:47.229
Now if we look at this file, the hello file down here,

80
00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:53.411
you'll see that the group commission is the r and the x,

81
00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.366
and that means that anyone in my group can read the file,

82
00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:03.257
but anyone else can execute the file,

83
00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:05.896
anyone on my group can execute the file.

84
00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.982
You can see the same thing repeated in the last column,

85
00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:12.870
and that means that anyone who comes to this machine

86
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.217
if they're signed in they can run that file.

87
00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:17.655
So if I had like a guest user sign in

88
00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:19.564
that isn't part of the staff group,

89
00:04:19.564 --> 00:04:23.867
they can still run this file and that will work,

90
00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:27.121
and they can actually look at the contents of it as well.

91
00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.621
But if we go into the rems-dir

92
00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:33.997
and look at what's in there

93
00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:35.878
we look at the permissions again,

94
00:04:35.878 --> 00:04:39.766
remember the first three is the owner, the user,

95
00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:41.537
the person who owns the file,

96
00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:42.908
and in that case it was remy,

97
00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:44.868
and I might use it.

98
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:47.001
There's two different users, one is remy, and one is rem,

99
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:48.760
sorry if that's confusing,

100
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.681
and everything else is blank.

101
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.315
Even though I'm in the same group

102
00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:55.196
it means that I can look at the file

103
00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:57.924
and have permission to look at the file.

104
00:04:57.924 --> 00:05:00.153
So if I wanted to be able to read the file

105
00:05:00.153 --> 00:05:04.363
I would need to have a read permission just here.

106
00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:06.873
So I'm gonna use sudo to do that,

107
00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:08.037
and I'm gonna change permissions.

108
00:05:08.037 --> 00:05:10.037
In fact actually I'm gonna show,

109
00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:11.193
before I do that I'm gonna show you

110
00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:13.407
the same permissions but with finder.

111
00:05:13.407 --> 00:05:14.913
So if we open up this directory

112
00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:17.484
and we look at the, oops,

113
00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:19.345
oh where did we go?

114
00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:21.614
Go back to finder and look at permissions on this file.

115
00:05:21.614 --> 00:05:23.714
So if I just do Command + I,

116
00:05:23.714 --> 00:05:27.806
I think it's one of these things, Get Info,

117
00:05:27.806 --> 00:05:29.723
down here in the corner

118
00:05:30.977 --> 00:05:34.525
you can see permissions and sharing and so on.

119
00:05:34.525 --> 00:05:37.608
So we can see that the owner is remy,

120
00:05:39.135 --> 00:05:41.788
and that person has read write permissions,

121
00:05:41.788 --> 00:05:44.463
and everyone else has no access.

122
00:05:44.463 --> 00:05:46.353
Now I can unlock that,

123
00:05:46.353 --> 00:05:50.020
which is the same as effectively doing sudo,

124
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.578
then go ahead and change those permissions.

125
00:05:53.578 --> 00:05:56.045
I'm gonna change that for remy,

126
00:05:56.045 --> 00:06:00.063
but I can change it to read only for everyone else.

127
00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:03.980
So let's see how that affects things over here.

128
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:05.984
Okay, so if you look at

129
00:06:05.984 --> 00:06:07.613
I've done the directory listing again

130
00:06:07.613 --> 00:06:10.653
you can see that now in the other column,

131
00:06:10.653 --> 00:06:12.486
so user, group, other,

132
00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:17.672
other users have read permissions,

133
00:06:17.672 --> 00:06:20.445
so if I cat that file out,

134
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:22.778
still don't have permission.

135
00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:27.625
Read only, you have no access,

136
00:06:28.573 --> 00:06:29.406
oh...

137
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.629
We have to have the group,

138
00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:36.879
which I don't know how to do from here.

139
00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:40.150
Read write.

140
00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:47.144
That's a bit silly that you can't do it from there,

141
00:06:47.144 --> 00:06:51.144
but we can actually do it from the command line.

142
00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.889
I guess I could add myself individually, rem.

143
00:06:57.992 --> 00:06:58.909
I can read.

144
00:07:03.598 --> 00:07:04.528
I can read it.

145
00:07:04.528 --> 00:07:06.981
I'm gonna abort using the finder,

146
00:07:06.981 --> 00:07:08.549
'cause I just wanted to show you that it existed

147
00:07:08.549 --> 00:07:10.608
and can do permissions.

148
00:07:10.608 --> 00:07:12.848
If we go back here,

149
00:07:12.848 --> 00:07:15.517
so the permissions are back to the way they were before.

150
00:07:15.517 --> 00:07:17.605
I can't cat the file out,

151
00:07:17.605 --> 00:07:20.355
but if I do sudo and then change,

152
00:07:22.097 --> 00:07:24.097
chmod, change mod, mode,

153
00:07:27.349 --> 00:07:31.239
mode, yes, okay so chmod means change mode,

154
00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:35.176
and what we're gonna do is make the group

155
00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:36.843
be read permissions.

156
00:07:37.994 --> 00:07:41.124
So we put the file in there, secret.

157
00:07:41.124 --> 00:07:42.750
So we're doing a few things,

158
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.275
we're doing sudo, so we're running it as root,

159
00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:48.915
and we're changing the mode of the file

160
00:07:48.915 --> 00:07:51.535
and we're giving the group,

161
00:07:51.535 --> 00:07:55.037
we're plussing on read permissions to the file secret.

162
00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:57.537
So let's see how that changes.

163
00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:00.965
We see an r there

164
00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:03.826
and we can cat the file out again.

165
00:08:03.826 --> 00:08:06.576
Okay, so this is fairly intuitive

166
00:08:09.074 --> 00:08:12.491
when you come to think of like u is user,

167
00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:16.786
g is group, o is everyone else, others,

168
00:08:17.626 --> 00:08:20.096
and you have read, write, and execute.

169
00:08:20.096 --> 00:08:23.346
So if I do chmod rw and I list it again

170
00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:29.354
you can see now I've got read write access.

171
00:08:29.354 --> 00:08:33.253
There is another way of doing chmod with numbers.

172
00:08:33.253 --> 00:08:35.200
So I'm showing you just so that you're not surprised

173
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.105
when you ever come across it.

174
00:08:38.105 --> 00:08:40.056
The numbers relate to each column.

175
00:08:40.056 --> 00:08:42.639
So if I had 777, three columns,

176
00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:46.627
it's a bit (mumbles) number,

177
00:08:46.627 --> 00:08:48.224
and I could never remember the order precisely.

178
00:08:48.224 --> 00:08:51.724
I think read is one, so if we just do 111.

179
00:08:52.685 --> 00:08:54.246
Nope.

180
00:08:54.246 --> 00:08:57.952
Oh, one is execute, two is write I guess,

181
00:08:57.952 --> 00:09:01.452
so we would do 3, which is one plus three.

182
00:09:04.622 --> 00:09:07.539
Yeah, and we basically add them up.

183
00:09:08.502 --> 00:09:12.275
What do we do, two four and seven is read, write, execute.

184
00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:13.775
So we would do 40.

185
00:09:19.722 --> 00:09:24.274
So that does read, write, execute for the user,

186
00:09:24.274 --> 00:09:27.093
4 is read for the group,

187
00:09:27.093 --> 00:09:30.022
and 0 is nothing for everyone else.

188
00:09:30.022 --> 00:09:31.032
I'm just showing you

189
00:09:31.032 --> 00:09:34.865
so that you know it exists in the first place,

190
00:09:35.771 --> 00:09:39.229
but if you're actually doing chmod on the command line

191
00:09:39.229 --> 00:09:41.273
then you want to use,

192
00:09:41.273 --> 00:09:43.336
I recommend using the text version.

193
00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:45.469
It's a little bit easier to read.

194
00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:48.039
There's just one final part to this.

195
00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:50.739
Now we can change your permissions, that's fine and dandy,

196
00:09:50.739 --> 00:09:52.499
but what if we actually want to own the file?

197
00:09:52.499 --> 00:09:55.877
What if we want to be able to make us the user

198
00:09:55.877 --> 00:09:57.963
rather than this other user remy?

199
00:09:57.963 --> 00:09:59.325
Well we can do that as well.

200
00:09:59.325 --> 00:10:02.408
We can do chown, so change ownership.

201
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:08.272
If I do chown, I put in the user rem, which is me,

202
00:10:08.272 --> 00:10:11.902
file name, let's see, permission denied,

203
00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:16.069
but if we do sudo we've now changed the ownership to rem,

204
00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.947
which means that I can chmod it as I please.

205
00:10:19.947 --> 00:10:22.447
So let's take off the execute,

206
00:10:23.776 --> 00:10:24.943
so u-x secret.

207
00:10:28.707 --> 00:10:31.377
There we go, we weren't asked for the password,

208
00:10:31.377 --> 00:10:34.029
because we are the owner of the file,

209
00:10:34.029 --> 00:10:38.429
we are that user in that first column, okay?

210
00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:42.237
So chmod is permissions, or the mode of the file,

211
00:10:42.237 --> 00:10:44.434
so we have read, write, and execute,

212
00:10:44.434 --> 00:10:45.363
and there are three groups,

213
00:10:45.363 --> 00:10:46.863
there is the user,

214
00:10:47.712 --> 00:10:49.829
which is the person who actually owns the file,

215
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:51.912
the group, and then the max case

216
00:10:51.912 --> 00:10:54.362
where we're under the same group, the staff,

217
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.945
we can also make it executable,

218
00:10:58.028 --> 00:10:59.230
and to make it executable

219
00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.480
chmod u+x, executable,

220
00:11:07.304 --> 00:11:08.714
and then the file name,

221
00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:10.344
and then finally chown,

222
00:11:10.344 --> 00:11:12.763
so we can change the ownership of the file or directory,

223
00:11:12.763 --> 00:11:16.100
and we can do this to files and directories.
