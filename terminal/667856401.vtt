00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.090
<v ->So now that we've seen how to make a mess of our machine,</v>

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.570
I wanna show you a few tools for checking the health

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.840
and status of the machine.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.411
So the first ones we're gonna look at is for disc space.

5
00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:17.810
Again, just to repeat it, you can, if you have

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.509
a good way to check these kinda things,

7
00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.869
it's worth using those.

8
00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.451
But I wanna show them so that you how to use them

9
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:26.629
on a machine that you might have connected to.

10
00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:29.160
So the first one is disc free.

11
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.611
So if I run disc free I get a lot of numbers

12
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:35.543
and stuff that isn't particularly useful to me,

13
00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:39.440
and I'm pretty much hard-wired to do DF dash KH.

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.607
That means if we looked at the man page for DF rather,

15
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:47.871
that gives us two extra things.

16
00:00:47.871 --> 00:00:50.803
First one is it groups these blocks,

17
00:00:50.803 --> 00:00:54.400
instead of being bytes, it gives me kilobytes,

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.221
so the K means kilobytes.

19
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:58.771
I can do megabytes instead.

20
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.938
It just means that it divides the bytes differently.

21
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:07.611
It also gives me a human readable number.

22
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:09.331
And it's really the human readable number that I'm

23
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.731
most interested in, and I'm pretty sure you can do

24
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:15.898
the same thing on LS as well, dash H, human readable.

25
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.934
Now what that's giving me a glance

26
00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.250
is that I have 350 or 345 gig

27
00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.593
available on my MAC.

28
00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:34.760
Now I've got the size of the drive, the amount used

29
00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:39.182
amount available and the percentages

30
00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:41.917
of the things I'm interested in,

31
00:01:41.917 --> 00:01:44.409
but there's also other drives here that mounted.

32
00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.507
And these are more virtual drives

33
00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:49.837
that I'm not particularly interested in

34
00:01:49.837 --> 00:01:51.206
when I'm looking at this information.

35
00:01:51.206 --> 00:01:53.558
I'm looking for dev disc one.

36
00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:56.197
When I have like a USB drive mounted,

37
00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:59.197
it will list it here as well as dev.

38
00:02:03.817 --> 00:02:06.057
It'll be a different disc number in fact.

39
00:02:06.057 --> 00:02:09.355
So we'll see them listed here.

40
00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:13.107
Now if I just switch over to this second tab I've opened,

41
00:02:13.107 --> 00:02:17.896
I've gone and signed into the production machine for JS Bin,

42
00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:22.063
and as you can see, when I've done DF dash KH or MH,

43
00:02:25.657 --> 00:02:27.095
I get slightly different output because it's

44
00:02:27.095 --> 00:02:29.737
different operating system running

45
00:02:29.737 --> 00:02:32.570
different kind of flavour of Linux.

46
00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:37.706
And what I've got here is human readable values

47
00:02:37.706 --> 00:02:41.107
that tells me that the dev drive

48
00:02:41.107 --> 00:02:45.274
at X, whatever it is, has got about eight gig on it,

49
00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:50.254
and we're just over 60% usage.

50
00:02:51.097 --> 00:02:52.655
Now that number doesn't really climb very much,

51
00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.375
so I'm kind of happy with that.

52
00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:58.217
The rest of these are kind of virtual drives.

53
00:02:58.217 --> 00:03:00.355
Anything on dev means it's actually mounted.

54
00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:04.113
And I can see I've got roughly 150 gig mounted here,

55
00:03:04.113 --> 00:03:08.667
and the place it's mounted on, that's how I access it.

56
00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.899
See, if we look back on my local machine,

57
00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:14.158
we can see I'm mounted on Roots here.

58
00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:15.767
I actually have three drives.

59
00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:19.099
One is the main one that's in, that is Roots.

60
00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.682
But I also have this slash MMT,

61
00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.845
which has some bits on it, really the log directory.

62
00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:29.845
And I also have this MMT

63
00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:34.865
old JS Bin, which is an old backup drive that I have.

64
00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:39.939
So I have multiple drives mounted on this machine,

65
00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.910
and it lists the available disc space here.

66
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.743
So going back to my local machine,

67
00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.670
we may wanna know where that disc space is being taken,

68
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.507
so if I list out the directories, I could go ahead

69
00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:55.139
and try and add these numbers up.

70
00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.750
We could put human readable again.

71
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.198
Like I say, it's 100 bytes for a directory.

72
00:04:00.198 --> 00:04:02.531
The freezing log is 57K now,

73
00:04:05.248 --> 00:04:10.178
but we can use a command called DU, so disc usage.

74
00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:14.938
If I hit enter, it's gonna search every single category

75
00:04:14.938 --> 00:04:18.771
and show me the disc usage for each directory,

76
00:04:20.518 --> 00:04:24.917
including parent directories and everything.

77
00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.619
I think right at the bottom there is the amount

78
00:04:26.619 --> 00:04:29.638
of disc space used by this directory,

79
00:04:29.638 --> 00:04:30.596
and again it's in bytes.

80
00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:32.596
So I wanna do DU dash H,

81
00:04:34.065 --> 00:04:36.815
which tells me it's using 46 gig.

82
00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:44.358
Using this directory specs the videos up in your recording.

83
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.370
And it lists everything.

84
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.319
Depending on how big the drive is or the directory

85
00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:50.670
you're looking at, can take a long time,

86
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.470
and maybe you don't want all the previous information,

87
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.679
so we have dash S, which is giving me the summary number.

88
00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.359
That's 46 gig, so I can see there's a lot of files

89
00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.060
in this public directory.

90
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.893
And if I go to maybe applications,

91
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.079
I can do the same thing, but it'll only look

92
00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:10.901
in the applications directory.

93
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:12.984
If I look at the library,

94
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:17.199
do the same thing, actually there's a gig there.

95
00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.689
So disc usage is a way of getting

96
00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.050
the amount of disc usage, how much space is being used

97
00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.781
by a particularly directory.

98
00:05:25.781 --> 00:05:30.449
So I tend to use, but one thing I might do actually,

99
00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.119
I'll run a disc usage without the summary,

100
00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:35.501
but I'll pipe it, sorry, not pipe it.

101
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.141
I'll redirect the output.

102
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.980
Instead of putting it into the terminal,

103
00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.397
I'll redirect it into a file.

104
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.119
So now, instead of printing the output,

105
00:05:47.119 --> 00:05:49.330
it'll put it all inside this report file,

106
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.239
and if I do less report, I can then go through

107
00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:54.319
and look at it.

108
00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.290
And from there, if I get rid of the dash H,

109
00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.690
and actually just have bytes,

110
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.107
I can do things like sort dash MR report,

111
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:07.170
and then I can look at what's taking up

112
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.453
the most of amount of disc space,

113
00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:09.453
so I can see

114
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.610
this particular file has a very big media directory.

115
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.119
I went right through.

116
00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:19.301
You see I'm using the sort command,

117
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:21.850
and using the numerical column, that first numerical column

118
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.690
that shows number of bytes.

119
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.529
Doesn't particularly tell me how big that is

120
00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.821
because I can't quickly convert to megabytes in my head,

121
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.982
but I can see that that's where the big directory is.

122
00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:34.944
So that's the kind of thing I would use it for.

123
00:06:34.944 --> 00:06:38.027
So that was disc free and disc usage.

124
00:06:40.973 --> 00:06:43.253
And next we've got processes.

125
00:06:43.253 --> 00:06:45.838
So we've looked at PS already,

126
00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:48.523
auxww gives me a list of all the processes,

127
00:06:48.523 --> 00:06:50.965
but it does like one snapshot at a time.

128
00:06:50.965 --> 00:06:54.923
Now there is another command that I will use

129
00:06:54.923 --> 00:06:57.341
quite frequently, called top,

130
00:06:57.341 --> 00:07:00.013
which, depending on the operating system,

131
00:07:00.013 --> 00:07:02.552
appears differently, so this is what top looks like

132
00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:06.453
for a MAC, and I'm personally not very used to it.

133
00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:08.813
And this is what top looks like on a Linux machine,

134
00:07:08.813 --> 00:07:11.482
so I am used to this kind of thing.

135
00:07:11.482 --> 00:07:14.152
So again, this is the production machine on JS Bin,

136
00:07:14.152 --> 00:07:16.661
and I can see a whole bunch of different

137
00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:18.552
bits of information here.

138
00:07:18.552 --> 00:07:21.723
Now the first one is, I think,

139
00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:24.140
I can sort by memory, by CPU.

140
00:07:26.923 --> 00:07:27.756
Oh, help.

141
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.923
Yes, CPU, okay, so when I press C,

142
00:07:34.923 --> 00:07:38.301
it sorts by most CPU being used,

143
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:40.901
and I can see that there is this command node

144
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:42.752
that is using quite a lotta CPU right now.

145
00:07:42.752 --> 00:07:45.082
So it means that it is pretty CPU intensive,

146
00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:48.249
and it's using 40% of the memory.

147
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:53.301
So up here I've got memory.

148
00:07:53.301 --> 00:07:55.872
And it tells me how much memory is available,

149
00:07:55.872 --> 00:07:57.212
how much is used.

150
00:07:57.212 --> 00:07:59.571
Really what I'm looking at is the free amount memory.

151
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:01.923
So we've got about 80 meg free, which is fine.

152
00:08:01.923 --> 00:08:04.923
Having no free memory is fine

153
00:08:04.923 --> 00:08:08.962
as long as we're not going into this thing swp,

154
00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:11.882
and now we're going into ops a little bit.

155
00:08:11.882 --> 00:08:16.049
I always want my swp to be reasonably low, two meg.

156
00:08:18.221 --> 00:08:19.872
Oh that's seven meg.

157
00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:23.712
Anyway, if I proceed I'll get the long command,

158
00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:24.545
the full command.

159
00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.632
So before, I just had node,

160
00:08:26.632 --> 00:08:29.573
Engine X node appeared a couple of times,

161
00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:31.042
press C, I get the full command.

162
00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:34.803
I can see that this is the main JS Bin process,

163
00:08:34.803 --> 00:08:37.101
we have a stats D thing running here.

164
00:08:37.101 --> 00:08:40.323
We have some Engine X running, and then cache and so on,

165
00:08:40.323 --> 00:08:43.133
so we have a bunch of different processes running together.

166
00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:45.603
Compare that to top on my MAC,

167
00:08:45.603 --> 00:08:48.341
it looks very different.

168
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:51.221
Even the columns are in different orders.

169
00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:52.138
We do have,

170
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:57.992
we have memory here, but I can't, to me it's not the same.

171
00:08:57.992 --> 00:09:02.053
But you can instal another top programme.

172
00:09:02.053 --> 00:09:04.853
So if you use brew or instal Htop,

173
00:09:04.853 --> 00:09:07.686
it's like a visual version of top,

174
00:09:09.653 --> 00:09:13.013
and it's much more similar to the activity monitor.

175
00:09:13.013 --> 00:09:14.613
And I believe you can instal Htop

176
00:09:14.613 --> 00:09:17.032
on other machines as well.

177
00:09:17.032 --> 00:09:20.413
So, this is a bit more easy to read.

178
00:09:20.413 --> 00:09:23.322
So I can see the process using the most CPU

179
00:09:23.322 --> 00:09:24.821
on this machine right now

180
00:09:24.821 --> 00:09:28.632
is ScreenFlow, the recording I'm doing right now.

181
00:09:28.632 --> 00:09:31.592
I can see the list of CPUs, so I've got four cores

182
00:09:31.592 --> 00:09:32.971
in this machine.

183
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:36.272
I can see that they're all doing a bit of work,

184
00:09:36.272 --> 00:09:39.320
which is good, rather than being topped out.

185
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.152
See the amount of memory being used.

186
00:09:41.152 --> 00:09:43.235
I can see swp being used.

187
00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.510
I'm not sure if it is using any swp or not.

188
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:51.677
I think red even means, I don't know, I'm not sure.

189
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.971
But memory, maybe green is free.

190
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:57.891
That could be it.

191
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.432
But from here, I think I can also kill processes as well,

192
00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:02.581
so you see down here, F9.

193
00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:05.451
If I wanna kill some processes, I can do.

194
00:10:05.451 --> 00:10:07.368
Let's try killing Htop.

195
00:10:09.512 --> 00:10:12.595
This is asking me to send the signal,

196
00:10:13.941 --> 00:10:16.108
so hit enter, killed Htop.

197
00:10:18.728 --> 00:10:21.798
And the other thing to notice here as well,

198
00:10:21.798 --> 00:10:25.631
couple of bits, load time up here, and uptime.

199
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.240
So uptime tells me how long the machine's been running.

200
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.189
So I haven't rebooted this machine in just over a month.

201
00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:37.000
So that tells me how it's been actually turned on for.

202
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.028
And the load average,

203
00:10:38.028 --> 00:10:40.778
it's a moving average of how much

204
00:10:42.859 --> 00:10:44.846
the machine is under load.

205
00:10:44.846 --> 00:10:48.149
There are, I think there's public algorithms

206
00:10:48.149 --> 00:10:49.819
how this is worked out.

207
00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:53.379
The way I read it is very much kind of finger in the air.

208
00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:54.847
Two is kind of okay.

209
00:10:54.847 --> 00:10:57.568
10, the machine's probably gonna be wearing a bit.

210
00:10:57.568 --> 00:10:58.739
100, you probably won't be able

211
00:10:58.739 --> 00:11:01.000
to do anything on the machine at all.

212
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.697
If we look across back to the production machine on JS Bin,

213
00:11:04.697 --> 00:11:07.330
I'll be looking at the load average up here,

214
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.291
nice and low, under one.

215
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:12.930
My web servers, I tend to want the load average

216
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.680
to be under two, and this is the,

217
00:11:18.349 --> 00:11:20.429
I think, the five-second average.

218
00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:22.539
This is the 30-second average,

219
00:11:22.539 --> 00:11:24.331
maybe five-minute average or one-minute average

220
00:11:24.331 --> 00:11:25.531
and five minute.

221
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:27.869
Furthest to the left is the freshest value,

222
00:11:27.869 --> 00:11:30.952
and this is the more long-term value.

223
00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:34.731
We have the same thing offline here.

224
00:11:34.731 --> 00:11:36.589
But I can also get it from the command line,

225
00:11:36.589 --> 00:11:38.331
just by typing uptime.

226
00:11:38.331 --> 00:11:41.669
So uptime gives me the load average, and it gives me

227
00:11:41.669 --> 00:11:43.490
how long the machine's been up and running.

228
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.760
The same thing on a production machine.

229
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.149
See these commands, they exist on different

230
00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:51.129
operating systems, but they give you the same

231
00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:52.691
kind of information, so I can see

232
00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:55.941
this machine's been up for over a year,

233
00:11:57.189 --> 00:11:59.168
which is kind of crazy to think about.

234
00:11:59.168 --> 00:12:00.989
It's got one user on it at the moment,

235
00:12:00.989 --> 00:12:03.699
which is the user I'm signed in with,

236
00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:05.971
and it has a load average of just under one,

237
00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:07.520
which I'm pretty happy with.

238
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.811
This machine has a load average of two,

239
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:11.600
coming up to three, because I'm recording

240
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.720
a video at the same time.

241
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.349
Reasonably healthy, I'm fairly happy with that as well.

242
00:12:16.349 --> 00:12:19.766
So those four commands, disc usage or DU,

243
00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.673
DF, disc free, and then we have Htop on a MAC,

244
00:12:25.659 --> 00:12:28.759
Htop you can instal on other machines as well.

245
00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:31.039
Pretty sure you do brew instal Htop,

246
00:12:31.039 --> 00:12:33.372
and uptime for a quick look.

247
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.131
And we also saw PS before,

248
00:12:36.131 --> 00:12:38.709
which I tend to use to grab

249
00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:42.541
individuals items out like Screenflow.

250
00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:44.549
Cool, so that is the end of

251
00:12:44.549 --> 00:12:46.250
how to shoot yourself in the foot

252
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.469
with commands, and how to get

253
00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:52.636
a little bit of health and the status of your machine.
