<v ->Following on from the environment variable screen cost,</v>

2
00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:05.903
you can also set default values

3
00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:08.355
and this is pretty handy for,

4
00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.393
again kind of development tasks where maybe you,

5
00:00:12.393 --> 00:00:15.941
normally always wanted to be port 8000,

6
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:17.635
but occasionally you want to change it.

7
00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.181
So when we ran this example at echo port

8
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:23.726
with no environment variable, no port it prints nothing.

9
00:00:23.726 --> 00:00:26.671
And we have to put the port in front of it.

10
00:00:26.671 --> 00:00:28.479
And but we can set a default,

11
00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:31.754
so if we have a look at echo default here,

12
00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:34.604
instead of just doing dollar port,

13
00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:36.937
I've made it so that it uses

14
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.027
the shell scripting,

15
00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:44.378
method that is if this value is undefined,

16
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.488
then use the value 3000.

17
00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:48.097
So let's see what happens when we run this.

18
00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:48.930
If I run it just by itself and we get 3000,

19
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.313
If I run it just by itself and we get 3000,

20
00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:55.840
but I can override the port by doing 333

21
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.245
and now I get a different port.

22
00:00:57.245 --> 00:00:59.662
And this is really handy for,

23
00:01:01.114 --> 00:01:02.114
things like,

24
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.292
packages, and,

25
00:01:05.488 --> 00:01:08.113
default kind of starting scripts so here

26
00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:10.710
this is a package from the terminal training website,

27
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.710
where I say to run this,

28
00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:18.636
node server use this serve command at use port,

29
00:01:18.636 --> 00:01:20.319
and they're like pass in so I

30
00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:22.798
can specify port 3001 for instance,

31
00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:25.667
but if there's no port passed in then you use port 3000.

32
00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.340
So I can do npm start and it would just run the server

33
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.741
or I can do port equals 3001 npm start

34
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:35.511
and it would use the port 3001.

35
00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:37.854
So that's a good way of having a default value.

36
00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:39.849
I wouldn't normally always use this,

37
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.269
but like I said it's really handy for just

38
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:44.889
that little thing where sometimes you want

39
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.329
to be able to tweak the value.
