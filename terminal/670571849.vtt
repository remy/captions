00:00:01.623 --> 00:00:02.788
<v ->What we're gonna look at now</v>

2
00:00:02.788 --> 00:00:05.892
is something called fish or fish shell.

3
00:00:05.892 --> 00:00:09.043
Now, when we are in our normal shell,

4
00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:11.176
what we've seen before is something called bash,

5
00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:13.834
which is very much a typical shell that everyone has,

6
00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:17.303
and the shell that I personally run is called Z shell,

7
00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:18.691
which I'm gonna show you later on.

8
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:23.626
But fish shell is a really good kind of starting point.

9
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:26.876
It's almost enough for a lot of people.

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.475
So it gives you a lot of nice features,

11
00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:34.823
and you can see it on this home screen.

12
00:00:34.823 --> 00:00:36.542
One of the first things that we'll see in a moment

13
00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.115
when I actually show you it is the autosuggest.

14
00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:41.080
And that's when you start typing, it'll actually

15
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.800
bring up the full command and show it kind of dimmed out,

16
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.183
like auto complete in code completion, that kind of thing.

17
00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:51.683
It has kind of colours and things built in.

18
00:00:53.456 --> 00:00:57.623
There are a bunch of things that make it quite nice to use,

19
00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:02.282
but in particular, there's this web configuration

20
00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:04.643
that I'm gonna show you as well.

21
00:01:04.643 --> 00:01:07.349
To instal it, there's a bunch of options,

22
00:01:07.349 --> 00:01:09.355
it works on Windows, Linux and Mac.

23
00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:11.759
I have a Mac, so I chose one of these.

24
00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.269
I started off with the app, which worked fine

25
00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:18.498
but it gave me a link to click in and it opens up terminal,

26
00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:20.499
I then downloaded the installer.

27
00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.188
The two things are pretty much the same,

28
00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:25.512
but the installer just allows me to kind of

29
00:01:25.512 --> 00:01:29.191
run it more easily from iTerm, which I prefer to use.

30
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.274
I run the installer, and we get this.

31
00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:38.234
This is the bit that makes fish your default shell,

32
00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:43.030
so every time I open up iTerm at the moment,

33
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.136
I still see bash, but if I run this command,

34
00:01:46.136 --> 00:01:49.469
it will switch my default shell to fish.

35
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.975
So if I continue through this, doing the installation,

36
00:01:56.975 --> 00:02:00.162
it'll ask me for my password.

37
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:03.517
And it should be done, it hasn't asked,

38
00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:05.478
it hadn't told me to (mumbles) again.

39
00:02:05.478 --> 00:02:09.818
But if I go over to iTerm now and type in fish,

40
00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:12.564
I now have a slightly different prompt.

41
00:02:12.564 --> 00:02:15.628
And up here, because iTerm tells me what programme

42
00:02:15.628 --> 00:02:18.323
I'm running, let's see, fish is running.

43
00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:20.129
Now, if I wanna make that my default,

44
00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.296
let's go back to, I'm just gonna open up the, this thing.

45
00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:30.178
I'm just gonna copy and paste this, copy,

46
00:02:30.178 --> 00:02:33.892
back to the terminal, let's get rid of this, paste.

47
00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:37.552
Okay, so I need to type in my password

48
00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:39.390
just to make that permanent change.

49
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.165
Notice how it hasn't changed it to fish for me just yet.

50
00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:44.859
If I close the terminal and open it again,

51
00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.351
now you can see when I opened a fresh terminal,

52
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:50.868
there is this new prompt, and you can see

53
00:02:50.868 --> 00:02:52.581
things are slightly different.

54
00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:54.584
So let's have a look around.

55
00:02:54.584 --> 00:02:57.768
Firstly, type in ls, and so we're already starting to see

56
00:02:57.768 --> 00:03:00.460
that I type in ls -ltr a lot, so if I press

57
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.418
the right cursor key, it'll drop that in for me.

58
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:08.383
It has things like command completion,

59
00:03:08.383 --> 00:03:12.550
so if I type in n, it sees that the last thing I typed,

60
00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:18.600
beginning with n, was npm help it,

61
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.103
so I just hit right arrow, or right cursor,

62
00:03:21.103 --> 00:03:23.353
just fills that out for me.

63
00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:27.148
If I do npm and then hit tab a couple of times,

64
00:03:27.148 --> 00:03:29.232
there we go, so I'm just gonna do that again,

65
00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:33.233
npm or any command, really, and then hit tab a few times,

66
00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:37.554
and what it does is it gets all of the commands

67
00:03:37.554 --> 00:03:40.133
from like a big dictionary that you can instal,

68
00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:41.972
and I can just scroll through these, and look at them,

69
00:03:41.972 --> 00:03:43.730
some of them have descriptions that go with it as well.

70
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.166
So I could see we've got npm rebuild,

71
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:51.051
publish, prefix and so on, so I can just literally scroll

72
00:03:51.051 --> 00:03:53.663
through all of this, which is pretty useful.

73
00:03:53.663 --> 00:03:56.996
It also gives me a very nice view on all

74
00:03:58.233 --> 00:03:59.793
of the arguments I can give to npm.

75
00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:03.126
Like, I didn't know that it had this it,

76
00:04:04.046 --> 00:04:06.796
which is why I typed npm help it.

77
00:04:09.481 --> 00:04:11.154
So this is pretty cool.

78
00:04:11.154 --> 00:04:12.912
There was a command that I had to run

79
00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:16.495
to get that to work, let's go back to fish.

80
00:04:21.363 --> 00:04:23.122
Tell you what, I will include a link in the video,

81
00:04:23.122 --> 00:04:24.023
and you can click on it.

82
00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:28.190
Basically, the fish command, fish_update_completions,

83
00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.635
I ran that and it downloaded just a bunch of completions

84
00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:34.432
and gave that all to me.

85
00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:38.237
So when I type in npm or, let's have a look,

86
00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:41.552
what else have we got, what commands have I run recently?

87
00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:44.635
Grep, so I just hit tab twice, we got

88
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.349
these different grep commands.

89
00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.221
Never used anything other than grep here.

90
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:55.522
And I can do grep, oh, that's not help, grep -.

91
00:04:55.522 --> 00:04:58.462
By putting -, you can, and I hit tab a few times,

92
00:04:58.462 --> 00:05:01.643
you can see all the arguments that you can give grep.

93
00:05:01.643 --> 00:05:03.721
Really cool for just browsing through,

94
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.481
if you're someone who kind of learns

95
00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:09.648
by looking at what's possible, this stuff is really useful.

96
00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.401
So if I wanted to exclude something from pattern,

97
00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:17.117
there it is, --exclude, I can search for patterns

98
00:05:17.117 --> 00:05:19.034
from a file, very neat.

99
00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:23.626
The configuration, so at the moment I've got

100
00:05:23.626 --> 00:05:25.134
this kind of blue theme.

101
00:05:25.134 --> 00:05:28.928
If I type in fish config and hit enter,

102
00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:30.560
it'll open a web page config.

103
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.565
Now, the one important thing about this

104
00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:36.732
is that I get caught out on is the background colour here

105
00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:40.856
is purely for demonstration purposes.

106
00:05:40.856 --> 00:05:44.080
When you change the background, when you set it to dark,

107
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.370
or you choose this light background,

108
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.736
it's not gonna change the background of your terminal,

109
00:05:48.736 --> 00:05:49.715
you have to do that yourself,

110
00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:51.478
and I can show you that in a moment.

111
00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.091
So let's choose a different theme, Tomorrow,

112
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:57.677
background color's white, I'm gonna do Set Theme.

113
00:05:57.677 --> 00:05:58.697
Says it's done it.

114
00:05:58.697 --> 00:06:01.931
We'll go back to our terminal.

115
00:06:01.931 --> 00:06:04.938
And it says hit enter to stop.

116
00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:09.168
Now, the background is still black, so I have to

117
00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:13.661
go into my preferences, and I think it was Profile

118
00:06:13.661 --> 00:06:16.828
and Colours and Background, here we go.

119
00:06:19.174 --> 00:06:22.591
What we're gonna do is set that to white,

120
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:26.296
maybe not so white, maybe we just choose it

121
00:06:26.296 --> 00:06:30.296
from a drop-down, light background, there we go.

122
00:06:32.913 --> 00:06:33.913
Oh, ls -ltr.

123
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.347
And still kind of blue, but you can see

124
00:06:37.347 --> 00:06:40.534
some purple going on, I know we've got quite a light font,

125
00:06:40.534 --> 00:06:43.680
so I think, like I showed you before

126
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:47.808
in the previous video, I can change the font as well.

127
00:06:47.808 --> 00:06:51.391
Let's find a text and change the font to...

128
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.306
Courier, Bold maybe.

129
00:06:58.381 --> 00:07:01.631
Doesn't seem like a good idea, does it?

130
00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:05.850
Well, we can change the font here,

131
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.627
and I could put in Courier and just do

132
00:07:08.627 --> 00:07:11.324
a bit more customization.

133
00:07:11.324 --> 00:07:15.161
14, that'll do, I think I have to open a new tab,

134
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:16.161
there we go.

135
00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:20.689
So you can see there's some different colours going on.

136
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.316
There's also a few kind of aliases baked in,

137
00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:26.890
so I can do ll, and that's an alias

138
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.645
that gives me a shortcut to directory listings.

139
00:07:30.645 --> 00:07:32.812
I can go into, let's do...

140
00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:37.235
What else do we have, Documents.

141
00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:42.125
Let's go to this jsonbin.

142
00:07:43.438 --> 00:07:46.954
I think also you can see, I think if there's a mistake.

143
00:07:46.954 --> 00:07:50.877
So the public directory here, it's underlining it as valid,

144
00:07:50.877 --> 00:07:53.710
but if it's not a valid directory,

145
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:00.042
it stops underlining it, so you can see

146
00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:04.209
where it's a valid command, I think also if I do...

147
00:08:05.394 --> 00:08:08.625
Yes, so you can see that the command has gone red,

148
00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:09.849
let's just bump this up a bit more,

149
00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:12.465
the command has gone red here because fish is telling us

150
00:08:12.465 --> 00:08:16.632
that it's an invalid command, there's no lskf command.

151
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.628
And I could show you how to add that to your own shell

152
00:08:20.628 --> 00:08:22.339
if you don't wanna use all of fish,

153
00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:24.500
but you can see here it's purple if it's good,

154
00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.500
and red if it's no good.

155
00:08:28.038 --> 00:08:32.121
That's fish, there are also some other bits here,

156
00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:35.766
the prompt, I just wanna show you that.

157
00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:38.584
I've changed the tab, it says the config has been shut down,

158
00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:40.671
so I'm gonna close the window again

159
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:43.370
and just go back to the fish_config.

160
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.329
And then go back to the prompt, you can see my prompt

161
00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:50.316
is this rem@macbookpro, but I can do something different.

162
00:08:50.316 --> 00:08:51.747
Let's have a look what options we have,

163
00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:54.580
a whole bunch of different things.

164
00:08:55.792 --> 00:08:58.284
That looks pretty cool, I like that one.

165
00:08:58.284 --> 00:09:00.738
I've just clicked on it.

166
00:09:00.738 --> 00:09:02.738
I'm gonna do Set Prompt.

167
00:09:03.892 --> 00:09:06.882
There we go, wow, look at that, very cool looking,

168
00:09:06.882 --> 00:09:10.149
some kind of rainbow arrow thing.

169
00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.724
So really, the point about fish is that

170
00:09:12.724 --> 00:09:16.637
one of its mantras or ethos, I think,

171
00:09:16.637 --> 00:09:19.700
is kind of minimise the configuration.

172
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:22.311
Even though you can make these config changes,

173
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.618
there's a GUI that goes with it.

174
00:09:23.618 --> 00:09:26.234
We've got this web interface to make those changes.

175
00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:28.773
It suggests a bunch of themes, you can customise it more

176
00:09:28.773 --> 00:09:33.346
if you want to in here, in the colours and so on.

177
00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:35.638
But it kind of gives you a bunch of options

178
00:09:35.638 --> 00:09:37.722
in the first place, you can select the one you want

179
00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:40.055
and go with that, whereas...

180
00:09:41.342 --> 00:09:43.483
The prompts you can customise in any way you want,

181
00:09:43.483 --> 00:09:45.612
and I'll show you some of that.

182
00:09:45.612 --> 00:09:48.758
But really, sometimes you just wanna pick something

183
00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:53.297
that works, and fish is a shell that can give you that.

184
00:09:53.297 --> 00:09:57.398
I'll include some links to kind of further customizations

185
00:09:57.398 --> 00:10:00.873
and particularly plugins that you can use

186
00:10:00.873 --> 00:10:03.685
that can kind of extend on top of fish

187
00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:06.935
in the web notes to go with this video.

188
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:11.655
But otherwise, like I said, that's fish shell.

189
00:10:11.655 --> 00:10:13.247
Definitely worth checking out if

190
00:10:13.247 --> 00:10:15.859
you don't wanna do too much customization

191
00:10:15.859 --> 00:10:18.222
and get a lot of stuff for free, basically.
